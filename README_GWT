Installing GWT and related stuff:
---------------------------------

Add http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.7 as update site to your Eclipse Indigo.
Ensure that you have your proxy settings activated when installing from within the
SAP network and if necessary "Reload" the default Indigo and GWT update sites to
ensure all necessary features are found.

Create a sample project using "File - New - Project" and choose Google / Web Application.
The resulting project can be "Run As"ed using "Web Application" as launcher. This
pops up your default browser (e.g., Firefox), perhaps asking the user to install a
missing GWT plugin.

I wrapped the GWT JARs in a separate com.google.gwt.osgi bundle, exporting all but
the javax.servlet packages, as described in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Google_Web_Toolkit_and_Equinox.

I had to explicitly add the javax.servlet dependency to the new com.google.gwt.osgi bundle.
Otherwise, the cast of the GreetingsServletImpl to an HttpServlet would have been
unsuccessful.

Adjust the servlet URL alias in plugin.xml such that it corresponds to
/<application-name>/<service-name>. The <service-name> is usually specified
using a @RemoteServiceRelativePath annotation, such as

@RemoteServiceRelativePath("greet")

No GWT path library in the Eclipse project settings seems to be required to make
the project GWT-compilable and executable within an OSGi container with Jetty
support.

Next, create a new "Web Application" launch configuration, specifying in the "Server"
tab to not "Run built-in server." Instead, the running OSGi container's Jetty with the
registered servlet will be used. In the "GWT" tab I chose "Automatically select an unused
port" instead of providing a fixed Code Server Port.

With this, when I launch the new Web Application configuration, my Firefox opens,
e.g., with the URL http://127.0.0.1:8888/Com_sap_sailing_gwt_ui.html?gwt.codesvr=127.0.0.1:56824
and displays the web app. I can set breakpoints in the client part as well as in the servlet.

When you want to compile mulitple GWT modules in one project in one go, the GWT library
has to be on the project's build path and has to be the first in the Order and Exports tab.
