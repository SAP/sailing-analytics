Installing GWT and related stuff:
---------------------------------

Add http://dl.google.com/eclipse/plugin/3.7 as update site to your Eclipse Indigo.
Ensure that you have your proxy settings activated when installing from within the
SAP network and if necessary "Reload" the default Indigo and GWT update sites to
ensure all necessary features are found.

Create a sample project using "File - New - Project" and choose Google / Web Application.
The resulting project can be "Run As"ed using "Web Application" as launcher. This
pops up your default browser (e.g., Firefox), perhaps asking the user to install a
missing GWT plugin.
