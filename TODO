   "repository" on the target host

 - Re-install ssh keys on server

 - Set up a test server that tries to be always-on

 - Open test server firewall ports or forward a specific DNS name to test server port

 - Test fail-over in case one of the two Java VM fails

 - Pass test server info to BeTomorrow so they can start their wind test. Include
   information about the query API by which they can determine the success of the
   wind update

 - Set up two Expedition machines with RF and UMTS transmission, test killing one
