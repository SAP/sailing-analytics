 - Finish a first draft version of a GWT admin UI

   * "top" display, with time slider
   * configure one or more leaderboards from a selection of races, adjustable delay per leaderboard
   * each leaderboard has its own URL
   * wind display
   * Google Maps integration
   * store net / total points separately in Mongo, making them overridable in editable copy of leaderboard
   * time slider, adjustable delay per leaderboard
   * consider a per-user preferences page where leaderboard columns can be personalized at runtime
   * mark position entry capability, supporting "lost mark tracker" use case

 - New GWT-based leaderboard draft

   * generally based on existing leaderboard
   * scrollable!
   * edit mode for disqualifications / net / total point adjustments
   * Google Map integration
   * time slider, adjustable delay per leaderboard

 - smoothen GPSTracks; if a particular fix seems really off, producing a speed that is beyond
   what the boat class could possibly do, ignore the fix because it is obviously a mis-read.

 - Distribute wind data to their respective races; capture expedition wind not by race/event anymore because
   wind is already recorded by time and position; when seeking wind information, look for information
   closest in time/space; consider throwing NoWindException if certain thresholds are crossed

 - Launch Expedition wind capturing upon startup because it should no longer be event/race-specific

 - consolidate time point defaulting for servlet REST APIs

 - Now that we can update Course's waypoints, consider creating a RaceDefinition right upon
   receiving the Event/Race from TracTrac, using an empty list of waypoints. This may simplify
   the entire life cycle of RaceDefinition objects.

 - Improve Mongo-based tests by using Mongo transactions instead of waiting for prior transactions to complete
