====

 - Pass final production instance URL information to BeTomorrow for wind integration

 - Consider making averaging intervals configurable

 - consolidate time point defaulting for servlet REST APIs

 - Test fail-over in case one of the two Java VM fails

 - enable switching between our and TracTrac-provided leaderboard information

 - implement missing pieces of TracTrac Result API-based TrackedLegOfCompetitor

 - Now that we can update Course's waypoints, consider creating a RaceDefinition right upon
   receiving the Event/Race from TracTrac, using an empty list of waypoints. This may simplify
   the entire life cycle of RaceDefinition objects.

 - Improve Mongo-based tests by using Mongo transactions instead of waiting for prior transactions to complete
