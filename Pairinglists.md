#General
This page provides some useful information about pairinglists and the calculation of pairinglists.

###Quality
The quality of a pairinglist is measured by the standard deviation of its template. The main aim of a pairinglist is that every competitor competes against every other competitor equal times. So if all counts of matches against the other competitors are equal it would be a "perfect" pairinglist. The standard deviation which is used as quality describes the average deviation from this "perfect" state, so a very low number is better than a high number. The average quality of a pairinglist varies for different numbers of flights and fleets and competitors. If you think the quality is too bad, try to hit the refresh button and get a new template. 

###Flight Multiplier
In some cases it is necessary to reduce the transfer traffic while an event (e.g. if only electrical motorboats can be used). In this case you can use the flight multiplier. It will duplicate flights as often as given. In other words: the flights are repeated. Furthermore it will set the "Fleets Can Run In Parallel"-flag, so you can run the first fleets of the repeated flights in a straight row without any changes. If you use the flight multiplier a smaller template is calculated and duplicated, because of this the quality can be worse than normal.

###CSV-Export
If you want to use a csv-file to export a pairinglist into excel you have to download it by clicking the link. After that you have to follow these steps:

1. Go to the first cell of the space, where your template should be imported to.
2. Click on the "Data" tab of excel.
3. Click "From Text" and choose the csv-file, which you downloaded.
4.Now there should be a "Text import Wizard" window. You do not have to change anything in the first step and just click "Next>". 
5. In the second window you have to change "Delimiters" to "Comma" and click "Next>".
6. In the third step you do not have anything to change. Just click "Finish".
7. There should be a "Import Data" window. Click the "Properties..." button.
8. Check "Overwrite existing cells with new data, clear unused cells"
9. Click "OK".
10. Back in the "Import Data" window, click "OK".

Your data should be imported. You can adjust the columns to get good formatting.
