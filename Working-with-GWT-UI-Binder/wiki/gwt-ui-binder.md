# Working with GWT UI Binder

## Introduction

The GWT UI Binder technology uses HTML-like documents to describe the structure and static content of the UI. See the tutorial here: http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinder.html. With UI Binder, widgets are developed by declaring the widget's static HTML content in a `.ui.xml` file that more or less looks like HTML. By naming convention, a corresponding class related to the `.ui.xml` file. The class can bind its fields to elements in the `.ui.xml` file using Java annotations such as `@UiField`, matching with `ui:field` attributes in the `.ui.xml` file.

In the `.ui.xml` flie, elements can be used to represent widgets. In particular, all predefined GWT widgets are usually mapped to the `g:` namespace and can be used as in `<g:FlowPanel ui:field="someFieldName" />`. This will bind an instance of type `FlowPanel` to the widget class's field named `someFieldName` which has to be of type `com.google.gwt.user.client.ui.FlowPanel`.

## The Design and Development Process with Ubilabs

We chose to work with a partner for UI Design: Ubilabs in Hamburg, Germany. They use a framework called Jade for their Web development. Their git repository lives at `https://<yourgithubuser>@github.com/ubilabs/sap-sailing-analytics.git`. The output of the Ubilabs build process is a bunch of HTML files (matching the "partials" component structure used in Jade) and the corresponding CSS files. Ubilabs plans to commit this generated output regularly to their git repository so we can understand the changes that we need to map into our environment.

As Ubilabs does not use GWT, we need to map their build outputs to our GWT architecture. GWT UI Binder fits with this goal. For each Jade partial we develop a corresponding UI Binder widget. The CSS file generated by Ubilabs can be used as is for the UI Binder widget. The HTML file needs to be renamed to `.ui.xml` and its contents need to be adjusted to the UI Binder styles and elements.

Ubilabs will deliver two versions of the site: one for use on desktops and tablets, and another for smartphone use. We need to map both versions to GWT UI Binder and decide based on the user agent and viewport size which one to choose.

## Internationalization (i18n)

We're not yet decided on how to implement i18n. GWT offers two mechanisms that seem viable, see http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideUiBinderI18n.html. We could use  ...

## GWT Code Splitting

For the various areas of the site we don't always want to have to load a new page. Instead, we'd like to use the "places" pattern with a local history management. This goes together well with GWT Code Splitting (see http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html#patterns) which allows an application to load its parts when they are needed. This speeds up the initial loading process and keeps bandwidth consumption low.

We use the Gin framework (see https://code.google.com/p/google-gin/) to support us in this.
