The environments_scripts directory contains more directories, which map to environment types, each holding scripts and files useful to that environment. Each environment type also contains a "users" folder, which contains subfolders for each user on the system.
The build-crontab-and-cp-files script uses the contents of these subfolders to create and install a customised crontab for each user in the folder. It does this by concatenating one liner crontabs into an uber crontab.
Any time the crontab should contain a user's home directory, instead write PATH_OF_HOME_DIR_TO_REPLACE; if the crontab should
contain the path to the git directory, instead write PATH_OF_GIT_HOME_DIR_TO_REPLACE.
These are replaced by the build-crontab-and-cp-files script with the correct paths
