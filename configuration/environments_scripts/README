The environments_scripts directory contains more directories, which map to environment
types, each holding scripts and files useful to that environment.
Each environment type also contains a "users" folder, which contains
subfolders for each user on the system.
The build-crontab-and-cp-files script uses the contents of these subfolders to
create and install a customised crontab for each user in the folder.
It does this by concatenating one liner crontab files/links following the naming
pattern "crontab*" into an uber crontab.

For crontab snippet placeholder substitutions, please see
${GIT_ROOT}/configuration/crontabs/README.

The build-crontab-and-cp-files script is not installed to /usr/local/bin,
so in order to actually perform this crontab setup and file copying from 
on an instance, you will need to use the build_crontab_and_setup-files function
from imageupgrade_functions.sh, which copies the latest environment_scripts 
folder onto the local instance and then executes the build-crontab-and-cp-files 
script, within the directory. This allows for a single dependency and calling method.
Furthermore, it means the latest version of the build-crontab-and-cp-files script 
is always used.
