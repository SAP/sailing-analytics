# is assumed to have prepared content for user home folders in /root/temporary_home_copy,
# has set up the software packages, and that the user has mounted the volumes with their
# original content to /home, /var/log, et cetera.

# Call as follows:
#    setup-central-reverse-proxy-part-2.sh {external-ip-of-new-instance} {image-type}
# where {image-type} identifies the "environment" from configuration/environments_scripts
# which usually would be "central_reverse_proxy" here, passed in from the previous stage's
