This is the crontab repo and it contains one line crontabs for all the different environments.
These files are concatenated by the build-crontab-and-cp-files script. Any time the crontab should contain
a user's home directory, instead write PATH_OF_HOME_DIR_TO_REPLACE; if the crontab should
contain the path to the git directory, instead write PATH_OF_GIT_HOME_DIR_TO_REPLACE.
These are replaced by the build-crontab-and-cp-files script found under
configuration/environments_scripts.

Further replacements in the crontab snippets can be controlled by the names used for the
files or symbolic links used in the users/ directories, as follows:

    crontab-snippet@{PARAM1}={VALUE1}@{PARAM2}={VALUE2}...

will replace all occurrences of PARAM1 in the snippet by VALUE1, etc. The values can be
empty. If a value shall contain an @-sign, use @@ instead. For a / (slash) character
use an underscore _ character, and to produce a single underscore, double it (__), as
illustrated by the following example:

    crontab-snippet@EMAIL_ADDRESS=john.doe@@example.com@HOME_DIR=_home_john__doe_

It is good practice to name a reusable crontab snippet such that its parameters are
listed in its name, separated from the name and from each other with @-signs, as in

    crontab-snippet@USER@EMAIL_ADDRESS

which would indicate that two placeholders exist in the snippet that a name for a symbolic
link referencing this snippet shall configure.

Note: theses files are symbolically linked to, so beware of the ramifications of changes.
