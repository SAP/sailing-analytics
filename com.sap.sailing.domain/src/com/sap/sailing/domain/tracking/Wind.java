/**
 * Records a wind observation made at a certain position at a given time with an observed speed and a bearing.
 * Note that while nautically wind is usually specified in the direction it's coming <em>from</em>, for
 * computational purposes internally we measure the wind in the direction <em>to</em> which it blows.
 * Use {@link #getFrom} to get the "inverse" bearing.<p>
 * 
 * Note that sometimes a wind measurement is transmitted without its position. While this is useless
 * for wind field interpolation, it can still serve good uses when some wind direction is better than
 * no wind direction at all. In this case, {@link #getPosition()} will return <code>null</code>.
