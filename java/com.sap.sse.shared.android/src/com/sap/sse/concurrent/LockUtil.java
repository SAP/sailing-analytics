/**
 * Supports lock management for {@link NamedReentrantReadWriteLock} which is a specialization of
 * {@link ReentrantReadWriteLock} that provides enhanced tracing capabilities. This class offers a number of utility
 * methods which also support the propagation of locks from one thread to another. This can be used by threads to
 * testify that they will wait for another thread which therefore doesn't need to acquire the same locks again. This can
 * help to avoid deadlocks.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Locks are propagated from one thread to another in the form of counters managed in the {@link #propagationCounts} map that
 * count, how many other threads have propagated their lock held. When a thread needs to obtain a lock, it first checks
 * if this lock has a positive count in the map. If so, the lock doesn't need to actually be locked because some other
 * thread has asserted that it holds the lock already. Instead, a counter is incremented in the {@link #virtualLockCounts}
 * map that is used to monitor that the "virtual" locks are handled properly and that all of them have been unlocked
 * when unpropagation happens.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Unlocking is a bit trickier for read locks because even if a thread A holds the read lock, a thread B may still
 * obtain it. If A then propagates its locks to B, B needs to understand whether it last "obtained" the lock by just
 * incrementing the counter on the propagated lock, or by actually obtaining the lock itself, and then perform the
 * inverse operation. Note that lock propagation and unpropagation may happen more or less at any point in time
 * (synchronized on the receiving thread's {@link #propagationCounts} entry), so thread B may first actually obtain the read
 * lock, then receive propagated locks from thread A, then reentrantly lock again by incrementing the counter. The only
 * guarantee that users of the {@link LockUtil} class need to provide is that the locks are unpropagated only after
 * thread B is done with its locking operations as long as A waits for B. This in particular means that B is required to
 * unlock all locks it obtained (actually or virtually by incrementing the counter) before unpropagation happens. Note
 * also that more than one thread (A_1, A_2, ...) may propagate its locks to the same other thread B.
