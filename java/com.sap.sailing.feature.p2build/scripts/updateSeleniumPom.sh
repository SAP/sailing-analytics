# Call like this:    analyzeProduct.sh <my.product> <path-to-java/com.sap.sailing.selenium.test/pom.xml>
# Will patch the bundleStartLevel section in the pom.xml file so that all auto-start bundles
# configured in the product specification are also launched properly and with the correct start level
# for the Selenium tests.

# The product consists of the features and plugins it lists. Its <configuration> section overrides
# the startLevel and autoStart defaults (4 / false) for a subset of the bundle list obtained from
# the features and plugins lists. The features that our product consists of are partitioned into
# ".runtime" and non-".runtime" features. The ".runtime" features obtain their bundles from the
# target platform, whereas the non-".runtime" features take their features from the workspace.

# In order to derive the target/workspace bundles for a launch configuration, the bundles are
# extracted from the features. Those from the .runtime features are assigned to the target_bundles
# attribute, the others to the workspace_bundles attribute. Auto start and start level information
# will be set to default:default unless the bundle occurs in the <configuration> section of the
# .product definition in which case the start level and auto start values are copied from the
# .product's <configuration> section.
