Scripts that may help to convert an OSGi .launch configuration into the autostart configuration section
for the .product file.

Other scripts may help in adjusting the .launch configuration's start level and autostart settings to
what is defined in the .product file.

Example usage:

  analyzeProduct.sh ../raceanalysis.product ../../com.sap.sailing.server/SailingServer\ \(No\ Proxy\,\ GENERATED\).launch
