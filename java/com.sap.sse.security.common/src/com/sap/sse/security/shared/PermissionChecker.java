/**
 * The {@link PermissionChecker} is an implementation of the permission checking algorithm also described in <a href=
 * "https://wiki.sapsailing.com/wiki/info/security/permission-concept#algorithm-boolean-ispermitted-principalcollection-principals-wildcardpermission-permission-for-composite-realm">Permission
 * Concept Wiki article</a>. It checks permissions in four stages where earlier stages overwrite later.
 * 
 * 1. Firstly, the data object's ACL is checked if it grants or explicitly revokes the permission. 2. Thereafter, the
 * permissions directly assigned to the user are checked. 3. Finally the permissions implied by roles the user has are
 * checked. This includes roles qualified by the group/user ownerships of the objetcs to which they are applied.
