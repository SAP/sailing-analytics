 * 
 * For example, failed password authentication requests shall be logged by the realm using calls to
 * {@link #failedPasswordAuthentication()}, successful ones with {@link #successfulPasswordAuthentication()}. Using the
 * {@link #isAuthenticationLocked()} method, a realm can determine if the user account to which this object
 * belongs shall currently accept password authentication.

 * 
 * A possible strategy for an implementation could be to add an increasing delay for each failed password
 * authentication, but reduce or clear the delay after a successful password authentication.
