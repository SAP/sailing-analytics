/**
 * Grants and revokes permissions to a set of actions for an object on a per-{@link UserGroup} basis. This way, there
 * should usually be at most one instance of this type defined for one object to which access is controlled. The sets of
 * actions are keyed by the {@link UserGroup} to which they are granted/revoked. An action would, e.g., be something
 * like "UPDATE" in the permission EVENT:UPDATE:84730-74837-47384-ab987f9. Note that nothing but the action is required
 * for each group because the ACL pertains to a single object such that the type (e.g., "EVENT") as well as the object
 * ID are known and don't need to and make no sense to be specified.
 * <p>
 * 
 * It is allowed to use the {@code "*"} wildcard as an action string, granting access to all actions on the object
 * concerned. The same logic for permission implication as on {@link WildcardPermission} is applied when matching a
 * particular action passed to the {@link #hasPermission(String, Iterable)} method against the actions
 * allowed by this access control list (ACL).
 * <p>
 * 
 * The actions to be permitted or forbidden are provided as strings. To forbid a action, the action string is prefixed
 * with an exclamation mark '!'.
 * <p>
 * 
 * An access control list of this type can be combined with an object ID and display name into an
 * {@link AccessControlListAnnotation}, or it may, e.g., be attached directly to a DTO for serialization to a client.
