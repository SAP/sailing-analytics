/**
 * In permission strings, object identifiers used in the third part of the permission need to be unique only within the
 * scope defined by the type to which the object belongs. The type is assumed to be encoded as the first part of a
 * permission. For example, the permission string "LEADERBORAD:READ:My Leaderboard" has "My Leaderboard" as an object
 * identifier that needs to be unique only within the "LEADERBOARD" type's scope. In order to make the identifier unique
 * across types, the type name needs to be added to the identifier. Objects whose class implements this interface
 * combine a type-relative object identifier with a type identifier into an identifier that is assumed to be unique
 * across types.
 * <p>
 * 
 * {@link Object#hashCode() Hash code} and {@link Object#equals(Object) equality} are defined based on hash codes and
 * equality definitions of the two strings returned by {@link #getTypeIdentifier()} and
 * {@link #getTypeRelativeObjectIdentifier()}.
