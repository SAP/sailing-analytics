/**
 * A role definition provides an ID, a (changeable) name and a set of permissions. As such, it represents a group of
 * permissions that are frequently assigned together to users. For example, if an administrator at an event usually
 * required create/read/update/delete permissions on a typical set of objects, those permissions can be grouped in a
 * role definition and then be assigned to a user by simply instantiating a {@link Role} from this
 * {@link RoleDefinition} and assigning the {@link Role} to the user.
 * <p>
 * 
 * During instantiating, a {@link Role} may optionally declare a {@link Tenant} and/or {@link SecurityUser} parameter to
 * qualify the range of objects for which it implies its permissions. With no such qualifications, the role grants its
 * permissions to the user to which the role is assigned for <em>all</em> objects. If a {@link Tenant} and/or
 * {@link SecurityUser} parameter is declared, the object's {@link Ownership owning} {@link Ownership#getTenantOwner()
 * tenant} and/or {@link Ownership#getUserOwner() user} owner must match the actual {@link Tenant}/{@link SecurityUser}
 * object(s) used when instantiating the {@link Role} from this {@link RoleDefinition}. As different parameterizations
 * are possible for the same group of permissions, multiple {@link Role}s may be instantiated from a single
 * {@link RoleDefinition}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Equality ({@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} are expected to be based solely on the {@link #getId() ID}.
