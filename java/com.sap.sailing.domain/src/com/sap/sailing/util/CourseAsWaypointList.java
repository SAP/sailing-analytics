/**
 * Wraps a {@link Course} as a {@link List<Waypoint>} based on the course's {@link Course#addWaypoint(int, Waypoint)}
 * and {@link Course#removeWaypoint(int)} methods. This is convenient in case a {@link Patch<Waypoint>} is to be
 * {@link Patch#applyTo(java.util.List) applied} to a {@link Course}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Executions of all {@link #add(int, Waypoint)} operations that would lead to duplicate waypoint occurrences are
 * replaced by an insertion of a proxy waypoint. The insertion of the waypoint passed to {@link #add(int, Waypoint)} is
 * delayed until its occurrence is removed. This is necessary because moving of waypoints may be represented as a
 * sequence of insert/remove (instead of remove/insert) which would lead to duplicate {@link Waypoint} occurrences in
 * the course which is not permitted.
