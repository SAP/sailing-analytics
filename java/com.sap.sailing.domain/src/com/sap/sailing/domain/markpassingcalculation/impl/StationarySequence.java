/**
 * A sequence of {@link Candidate}s such that the track of smoothed GPS fixes between them fits into a bounding box that
 * has a maximum {@link Bounds#getDiameter() diameter} of {@link #CANDIDATE_FILTER_DISTANCE}. The first, the last and
 * the most probable {@link Candidate} for each {@link Candidate#getWaypoint() waypoint} for which this sequence has
 * candidates are considered valid and are returned from {@link #getValidCandidates()}. Note, that first, last and most
 * probably may fully or partly overlap, especially in cases with fewer than three candidates for a single waypoint.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A sequence can be updated by adding ({@link #addWithin(Candidate, Set, Set)},
 * {@link #tryToExtendAfterLast(Candidate, Set, Set)}, and
 * {@link #tryToExtendBeforeFirst(Candidate, Set, Set, NavigableSet)}) and by removing
 * ({@link #remove(Candidate, Set, Set, NavigableSet)}) candidates, as well as by
 * {@link #tryToAddFix(GPSFixMoving, Set, Set, NavigableSet, boolean) announcing GPS fixes} that were added to or
 * replaced in the underlying {@link #track}. If candidates are added/removed after changes to the track were made but
 * before those changes were {@link #tryToAddFix(GPSFixMoving, Set, Set, NavigableSet, boolean) announced},
 * inconsistencies regarding the bounding box may be observed. Fixes may have appeared that cause the bounding box
 * around the track between the first and the last candidate in this sequence to exceed the maximum "diameter" allowed
 * for a {@link StationarySequence} (see also bug 5087). The implementation reacts tolerant to such observations and
 * assumes that the call to {@link #tryToAddFix(GPSFixMoving, Set, Set, NavigableSet, boolean)} that announces the
 * offending change will be made at a later point in time, then making the necessary adjustments again. In particular,
 * the implementation will tolerate bounding box sizes in violation of the diameter rule if this violation is unexpected
