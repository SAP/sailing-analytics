/**
 * Filters one {@link Competitor}'s {@link Candidate}s based on the movement patterns between them. Objects of this
 * class can be used as a filter stage for the {@link CandidateChooser} implementation in order to keep the graph
 * constructed from candidates small. The candidate sequence is analyzed using a bounding box-based approach. As long as
 * the track that connects a sequence of candidates fits in a bounding box not exceeding a certain
 * {@link Bounds#getDiameter() diameter}, as determined by {@link StationarySequence}, those candidates are joined into
 * a "stationary sequence," and only a {@link StationarySequence#getBorderCandidates() short head and tail of the
 * sequence} pass this filter, assuming that with such a time range-based head/tail we capture the candidates relevant
 * for all waypoints to which they may apply. Other candidates that don't fall into a {@link StationarySequence} are
 * passed through by this filter.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This way, objects that were rather "stationary" won't feed huge candidate sets into the {@link #allEdges graph}.
 * Still, as a tracked object starts moving, candidates will be created, even for the stationary segment in the form of
 * a short leading and tailing candidate sequence representing this stationary segment.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The filter is created empty. It keeps track of all stationary sequences found so far and sorts them by time. The
 * algorithm guarantees that after a call to {@link #updateCandidates(Iterable, Iterable)} as well as after a call to
 * {@link #addFix} each stationary sequence has at least two candidates in them which passed the first filter state. No
 * stationary sequence can be extended to the next candidate following it or any previous candidate preceding it because
 * the track leading there would extend the stationary sequence's bounding box beyond limits, or the candidate outside
 * the sequence already belongs to an adjacent sequence. No two adjacent candidates that are not part of any
 * {@link StationarySequence} can be joined into a valid sequence.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Furthermore, all {@link StationarySequence}s maintain their invariant, in particular that the track leading from
 * their {@link StationarySequence#getFirst() first} to their {@link StationarySequence#getLast() last} candidate
 * remains within a bounding box whose {@link Bounds#getDiameter() diameter} remains below the threshold. Calling
 * {@link #getFilteredCandidates()} returns those candidates that were announced through
 * {@link #updateCandidates(Iterable, Iterable)} as being added, not being announced later through
 * {@link #updateCandidates(Iterable, Iterable)} as having been removed and that currently pass this filter.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Two adjacent {@link StationarySequence}s must not overlap. The {@link StationarySequence#getLast() last candidate} of
 * a sequence must be truly less---according to the {@link #candidateComparator}---than the
 * {@link StationarySequence#getFirst() first candidate} of the next sequence.
 * <p>
 * 
 * All sequences, candidates and the track belong to the same {@link Competitor}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This group of sequences must be {@link #addFix(GPSFixMoving) notified} about new position fixes received for the
 * competitor, and for {@link #updateCandidates(Iterable, Iterable) changes} in the set of {@link Candidates} available
 * for processing at this filter stage.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The approach implemented by this class makes no guarantee regarding maximum length stationary sequences. Finding such
 * segments with maximum length is considerably more expensive than finding "good" such segments with a "greedy"
 * algorithm. If we analyze the candidate sequence in chronological order and build up stationary sequences by a
 * "greedy" algorithm, not much harm will be done at the boundaries of two adjacent stationary sequences. Only the two
 * candidates at the sequence boundary would be added and we would also need a solution for which candidates to preserve
 * in case of overlapping stationary sequences. This seems acceptable. The approach will still help to significantly
 * reduce the number of candidates for trackers that remained stationary for a significant amount of time.

     * invariant it is not possible that the new candidate has two neighbors each part of a stationary sequence and all
     * fixes between them fitting into each of their bounding boxes; because if this were the case, the two sequences
     * would already have been merged.)</li>
     * <li>The candidate falls into an existing stationary sequence (at or after first and at or before last candidate
     * in sequence). In this case the set of fixes on the track considered within the sequence hasn't changed. The
     * candidate does not pass the filter, unless it is within {@link #CANDIDATE_FILTER_TIME_WINDOW} from the stationary

     * {@link #CANDIDATE_FILTER_TIME_WINDOW} to one of the sequence's borders, it used to be a candidate passing this
     * second filter stage and therefore has to be removed from both, the stationary sequence and the filter result. If

     * Informs this filter that for its competitor a new position fix was added or replaced. All necessary updates to
     * the stationary sequences managed by this filter are carried out, and the changes that this has to the result of
     * calling {@link #getFilteredCandidates()} are reported as the return value, with the {@link Pair#getA() first}
     * element of the pair being the candidates that now additionally pass this filter, and the {@link Pair#getB()
     * second} element describing those that no longer pass the filter.
     * <p>
     * 
     * The following cases can be distinguished:
     * <ul>
     * <li>A GPS fix was added to or replaces one of those in the competitor's track within the time range of an
     * existing stationary sequence. The fix needs to be added to the stationary sequence's bounding box. If the box
     * still remains small enough, nothing changes. Otherwise, the algorithm tries to extend the stationary sequence
     * from the last candidate before the new fix until the track lets the bounding box grow too large. A new stationary
     * sequence is started, adding all remaining candidates. Any sequence resulting from such a split and having only
     * one candidate left is removed. The candidates immediately left and right of the split now pass the filter and
     * therefore are added to the {@link #allEdges graph}.</li>
     * <li>A GPS fix was added outside any stationary sequence. Nothing changes because no bounding box would get
     * smaller by a new fix added.</li>
     * <li>A GPS fix <em>replaces</em> an existing one outside of any stationary sequence. In this case it is possible
     * that the fix replaced caused a bounding box to exceed the diameter threshold and thus avoided a stationary
     * sequence from being created or extended, and the new fix "smoothes" the track such that a stationary sequence may come into
     * existence or be extended. Therefore, if a fix is replaced outside of any stationary sequence, a stationary sequence creation or
     * extension attempt is made for any adjacent candidate towards the fix replaced. For simplicity, the extension
     * attempts will stop as they reach the next candidate, although slightly improved results may be
     * achievable by trying to merge two adjacent stationary sequences in their entirety where possible. We can, however,
     * be sure that we won't miss any possible segment between two candidates; being able to extend further than up to the next
     * candidate would mean that there must already have been a stationary sequence covering the segment from the next to
     * the one after the next, but that was excluded because we didn't want to extend into existing adjacent stationary
     * sequences.</li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @return the candidates that now pass the filter after applying the fix changes (and which didn't pass before) as
     *         the {@link Pair#getA() first} element of the pair returned, and the candidates that no longer pass the
     *         filter after applying the fix changes (and which did pass the filter before) as the {@link Pair#getB()
     *         second} element of the pair returned.
