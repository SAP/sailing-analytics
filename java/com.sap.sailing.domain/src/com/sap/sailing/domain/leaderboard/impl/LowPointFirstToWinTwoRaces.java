/**
 * This class is a derivation of the LowPointScoring scheme. The following additional rules apply:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The first participant in the medal series that wins {@link #getTargetAmountOfMedalRaceWins()} races is ranked as
 * the first.</li>
 * <li>Having 1 point in the carry forward column of the medal series explicitly counts as an additional win which
 * requires the winner of the qualification to only need one additional win in the medals.</li>
 * <li>If none of the participants in the medal series reached the target amount of 2 wins yet, the ranking is done
 * based on the points only.</li>
 * <li>If there is a carry forward column in the medal series, the carry forward points are used as the primary tie
 * breaking criteria in case two participants in the medal series have the same overall score.</li>
 * <li>If there is no carry forward column in the medal series or the carry forward score is not sufficient, the points
 * of the last medal race are used as a secondary tie breaking criteria.</li>
 * <li>This Scheme will change the default scoring factor for medal races to 1, usually 2 is used (see
 * {@link ScoringScheme#DEFAULT_MEDAL_RACE_FACTOR})</li>
 * <ol>
