/**
 * A leaderboard group is used to group one or more {@link Leaderboard}s. It can be used to represent all or part of the
 * regattas of an event or to establish a collection of regattas or leaderboards otherwise belonging together according
 * to some context. This could, for example, be a leaderboard group of all the interesting races in a particular boat
 * class or races at a particular event over time.<p>
 * 
 * The leaderboards grouped by this object have an iteration order that equals their insertion order. We have seen
 * cases where a user interface shall display the leaderboards in reverse insertion order. This behavior is described
 * by {@link #isDisplayGroupsInReverseOrder()}.<p>
 * 
 * Optionally, a leaderboard group can specify an "Overall Leaderboard". The typical use case for this is a regatta series
 * such as the Extreme Sailing Series or the German Sailing League ("Bundesliga") where several regatta results are
 * combined into a series score. The overall leaderboard, if defined, has its own scoring scheme and obtains its
 * "tracked results" from the results of the respective leaderboard. Each leaderboard in this group then represents
 * one race column in the overall leaderboard.
