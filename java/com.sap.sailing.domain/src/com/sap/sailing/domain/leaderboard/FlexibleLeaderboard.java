 * A leaderboard that allows its clients to flexibly modify the race columns arranged in this leaderboard without the
 * need to adhere to the constraints of a {@link Regatta} with its {@link Series} and {@link Fleet}s.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A leaderboard can be renamed. If a leaderboard is managed in a structure that keys leaderboards by name, that
 * structure's rules have to be obeyed to ensure the structure's consistency. For example,
 * <code>RacingEventService</code> has a <code>renameLeaderboard</code> method that ensures the internal structure's
 * consistency and invokes this method.
