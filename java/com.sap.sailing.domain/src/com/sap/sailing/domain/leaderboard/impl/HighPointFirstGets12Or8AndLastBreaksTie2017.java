/**
 * {@link HighPointFirstGetsFixedScore} scheme that in most cases applies
 * 12 points for the winner. Iff for one race column a {@link RaceLogAdditionalScoringInformationEvent}
 * is found then 8 points are applied for the winner.
 * 
 * From Phil, Race Director, on 12.09.2014: "If there is a tie in the regatta score between two or more boats at any time, the tie
 * shall be broken in favour of the boat that has won the most races. If a tie still remains, it shall be broken in
 * favour of the boat that had the better place at the last race sailed."
 * 
 * 13.1.2  A Boat that did not start, did not finish, or retired shall receive 1 point less than the last boat to complete the race.
 * 13.1.3  A Boat that is disqualified from a race, including OCS, shall receive 2 points less than the last boat to complete the race.
