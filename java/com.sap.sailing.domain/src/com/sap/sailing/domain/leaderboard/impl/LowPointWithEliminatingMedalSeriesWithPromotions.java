/**
 * A special low-point scoring scheme that uses one or more medal series to eliminate some competitors
 * during each such medal series. Competitors may be promoted to later series based on their opening
 * series results. For example, the scheme may define that the winner of the opening series automatically
 * advances to the final medal series, and the second and third ranking competitors advance to the last-but-one
 * medal series already; all others have to race a medal race/series to qualify for the next series, and
 * some of those will be eliminated on the way.<p>
 * 
 * The number of competitors from the opening series that qualify to later medal series is provided as
 * an array to the {@link #LowPointWithEliminatingMedalSeriesWithPromotions(int[]) constructor}.
