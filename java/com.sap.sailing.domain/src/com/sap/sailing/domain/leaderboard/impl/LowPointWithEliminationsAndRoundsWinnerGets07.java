/**
 * Implements an elimination scheme as used by surfing championships, based on a general low point scoring scheme. A
 * regatta is divided into "eliminations" where each elimination consists of a sequence of "rounds." Each round is in
 * turn divided into a number of "heats" (races). The final round in an elimination consists of a "final" race and a
 * "losers final" race. They constitute, in our terminology, one series with contiguous scoring. The winner of the
 * "losers final" gets one point more than the competitor ranking last in the "final" race. The winner of the final race
 * obtains 0.7 points. All other ranks are assigned points equal to the rank or the average of the ranks attained by
 * competitors ranking equal.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The semi-final has two heats, and the better half of the competitors in those heats get promoted to the "final," the
 * competitors ranking worse will participate in the "losers final." Points are usually not awarded in the semi-final
 * (exceptions for races not sailed see below).
 * <p>
 * 
 * In the quarter-final there are four heats. Usually, the competitors ranking in the top half of their heat are
 * promoted to the semi-final and are not awarded points for the quarter-final round (exceptions for races not sailed
 * see below). However, the race committee may decide how many competitors are promoted, also based on the number of
 * participant and resulting number and set-up of heats. Therefore, successful promotion can only be detected by looking
 * at the competitor assignments in the next round.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Those competitors ranking in the bottom part of their heat are not promoted to the next round and are instead awarded
 * points for the elimination based on their rank in their heat. Across all quarter-final heats, competitors not
 * promoted and having the same rank obtain equal points regardless their heat. The number of points is calculated as
 * the average of their rank in the elimination. Quarter-final participants rank better than those eliminated in earlier
 * rounds. Eliminated competitors rank better in the elimination if they obtained a better rank in their heat than other
 * competitors eliminated in the same round. For example, if each of the four quarter-final heat has eight competitors,
 * the four competitors ranking last (8th) in their heat get the average points for ranks 29-32 (30.5 points), whereas
 * the four competitors ranking 7th in their heat get the average points for ranks 25-28 (26.5 points), and so on.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Other rounds preceding the quarter-final work by the same principle as the quarter-final.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Should a planned heat not be sailed then all competitors assigned to that heat will obtain equal points based on the
 * average of the ranks for which they would have sailed. For example, if the final heat cannot be sailed, all
 * competitors who qualified for the final race obtain the average of 0.7, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 points (4.46 points).
 * <p>
 * 
 * During live tracking promotions cannot generally be decided due to the race committee's decision authority.
 * Therefore, also those competitors who ultimately will be promoted have to be given scores in their heat based on the
 * average points obtained by all competitors taking the same rank in their respective heat in the same round. This will
 * usually lead to a change in points awarded to the competitors promoted as soon as the promotion becomes "official"
 * which technically needs to be expressed by assigning the competitors to their heat in the next round. As soon as this
 * happens, the scores in the heat from which a competitor got promoted are set to <code>null</code>, and a score
 * corresponding to the average points given to the competitors of the heat to which the competitor got promoted is
 * inferred for that heat. Only when the race in that next heat produces non-zero ranks, the scoring rules for that
 * heat are applied again normally.<p>
 * 
 * The regatta is expected to be modeled such that fleet ordering numbers are used in a special way. Ordering
 * <code>1</code> is to be used to identify the Final heat, <code>2</code> for the Losers Final heat. For each earlier
 * round the ordering is increased by one and applied equally to all heats of that round. Therefore, the two semi-final
 * heats use ordering <code>3</code>, the four quarter-final heats use <code>4</code>, and so on.

    /**
     * The competitor gets a score in <code>raceColumn</code> if she does not participate in a race in the round that
     * follows the round represented by <code>raceColumn</code>. If <code>raceColumn</code> represents the last round in
     * the elimination, <code>competitor</code> can not participate in a next round and therefore obtains a score. This
     * can either happen when <code>raceColumn</code> is a final round or if the elimination has been aborted and no
     * further rounds exist in that elimination. The competitor is considered to participate in the next round if an
     * explicit score correction exists for the <code>competitor</code> for the next round, or if a tracked race is
     * attached to the race column following <code>raceColumn</code> that lists <code>competitor</code> as part of its
     * competitors.
     * <p>
     * 
     * If the <code>competitor</code> is to receive points for <code>raceColumn</code>, the following rules apply. For a
     * <code>0</code> rank this method assumes that the race has not started yet (and it could happen that it is never
     * started at all); in this case the number of points is calculated as the arithmetic mean of all points for which
     * the participants of the heat would race, with the first rank counting as 1.0 for this average. If the
     * <code>rank</code> is not <code>0</code> then the competitor receives the average of the points given to all
     * competitors from all heats in this round that rank equal when sorting the competitors of that round in the
     * leaderboard by their rank. For example, if there are two heats in the semi-final with eight competitors each, the
     * two competitors ranking second in their heat will get the average of 3.0 and 4.0 points, so 3.5 points.<p>
     * 
     * In the exceptional case of the final round, 0.7 points are awarded to the first rank. This special rules only
     * applies if a <code>rank</code> 1 is actually observed. It does not apply to the averaging process that occurs
     * should the final not have been sailed (yet) such that the final participants receive the points average of
     * 1.0, 2.0, ..., &lt;<i>number-of-final-participants</i>&gt;<p>

    /**
     * Assumption: no fleet has a number of competitors exceeding that of any other fleet in the same round by two or
     * more.
     * <p>
     * 
     * Background: an additional competitor will always be added to the fleet with the fewest competitors, implying
     * above rule.
     * <p>
     * 
     * Reason for assumption: with this, we can infer that there will be as many competitors ranking one rank better
     * than "rank" as there are fleets; were the assumption not fulfilled then there could be a fleet in the round that
     * has no competitor ranking one rank better. With this assumption we easily infer the best possible rank for all
     * competitors with "rank" which is the number of fleets in the round times "rank" plus 1.
     * <p>
     * 
     * Example: If rank is 7 and we have eight fleets, the best rank for all competitors with this rank will be 7*8+1 =
     * 57. The worst rank for all competitors with "rank" therefore can be calculated by the adding to the best rank the
     * number of competitors with this rank. We have to assume that this number may not be equal to the number of heats
     * in this round because with different heat sizes in a round the worst rank may be different for different heats
     * (e.g., 7 in some, and 8 in others, therefore fewer 8th ranks than 7th ranks will exist). This "uneven" case can
     * only apply if the competitor ranks last in the heat which is easy to exclude by looking at the tracked race, from
     * there the RaceDefinition and for that the number of competitors in that race.
