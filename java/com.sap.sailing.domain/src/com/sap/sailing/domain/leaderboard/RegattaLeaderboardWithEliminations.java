/**
 * A regatta leaderboard that is derived from another regatta leaderboard by eliminating a subset of the competitors and
 * that provides its own, unique name and optionally its own display name. This generally implements a "delegate"
 * pattern for a {@link RegattaLeaderboard}. It therefore does not maintain its own score corrections or set of
 * suppressed competitors. Note: "suppressed" is different from "eliminated" in that suppressed competitors do not show
 * in any race and are not assigned any rank in any race, but eliminated competitors are; they only don't receive a
 * regatta ("total") rank, and all competitors advance by as many ranks compared to the original leaderboard as there
 * are eliminated competitors ranking better in the original leaderboard.
