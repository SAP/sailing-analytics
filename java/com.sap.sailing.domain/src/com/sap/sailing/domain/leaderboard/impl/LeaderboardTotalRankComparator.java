/**
 * Compares two competitors that occur in a {@link Leaderboard#getCompetitors()} set in the context of the
 * {@link Leaderboard} according to their total rank at a given point in time. "Better" is represented as "lesser."
 * <p>
 * 
 * For a general {@link Leaderboard} we don't know about Series. In a {@link Leaderboard}, all we have are the columns
 * with their fleets which can be compared but may compare equal; also, we know if a column is a medal race column.
 * Participants of a medal race always score better than all remaining competitors. (We only know the medal race
 * participants if the column has a tracked race.) If both competitors scored in a medal race, this score will be
 * compared, regardless of the sum of any other scores.
 * <p>
 * 
 * If that hasn't decided the order yet, then as soon as we find a column with more than one tracked race with the fleets
 * comparing non-equal, this decides the order if the two competitors belong to different fleets.
 * <p>
 * 
 * If that still hasn't decided the order, the scores will decide. If the competitors scored in a different number of
 * races, the competitor scoring in more races is considered better (lesser). If they scored in an equal number of races,
 * the score sums are compared using {@link #compareByScoreSum(int, int)}. If that still doesn't decide the order, the scores
 * are sorted from best to worst and compared one by one. The first differing score decides. If all scores are equal pairwise,
 * both competitors are ranked equal.<p>
 * 
 * For a RegattaLeaderboard, if a column in a series has tracked races for all of its fleets, these competitors rank
 * better than all remaining competitors that appear in prior series. This is probably the generalization of the
 * "medal race" rule where the medal "series" has one race, and if it's tracked, its participants rank better than all
 * others in prior series who did not reach the medal race.

     * An on-demand map of competitors with their opening series rank, 1-based.<p>

     * later rounds/stages based on the "opening series" results. The opening series then is considered
     * to contain all races excluding {@link RaceColumn#isMedalRace() medal races}.<p>

     * in many of these comparisons. It would be unnecessarily expensive to compute that ranking upon each
     * such comparison. Instead, once requested by this comparator, it is cached and can be re-used by later
     * comparisons performed by this comparator's {@link #compare(Competitor, Competitor)} method.<p>
     * 
     * The implementation of the {@link Supplier} synchronizes on itself when {@link Supplier#get() asked}
     * for its value. If the opening series ranking has not been computed yet then this happens while
     * holding the supplier's monitor locked. This way, other threads waiting for the opening series
     * ranking will wait for the computation to complete. If the ranking has already been computed it
     * is returned immediately and the monitor is released quickly.
