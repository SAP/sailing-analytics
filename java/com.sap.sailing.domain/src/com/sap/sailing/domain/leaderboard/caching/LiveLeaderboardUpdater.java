/**
 * Computing a leaderboard live, particularly when the fleet tracked is large, requires considerable resources.
 * Live tracking events such as new GPS fixes and wind data make caching hard because caches need to be invalidated
 * frequently. Instead of computing a {@link LeaderboardDTO} on the fly when a client asks for it, in live mode it
 * is more adequate to keep updating a ("whiteboard") cache with results which can be served to a client in live mode.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This updater, when run, keeps updating its {@link #getLiveLeaderboard live leaderboard}. It is specific to a single
 * leaderboard name and accumulates a set of race columns for which to obtain the details. It stops when no client has been asking
 * for the live leaderboard's contents for more then {@link #UPDATE_TIMEOUT_IN_MILLIS} milliseconds. It is automatically re-started
 * by the next request received.<p>
 * 
 * Clients pass their requested set of expanded columns on to this updater when they fetch the current live result from this
 * cache. Each column requested by a client will continue to be updated by this updater into the live leaderboard result
 * for a {@link #UPDATE_TIMEOUT_IN_MILLIS specific time}.<p>
 * 
 * The updater keeps computing updates until {@link #UPDATE_TIMEOUT_IN_MILLIS} after the last client request for the
 * leaderboard for which this updater is responsible has been received. Then it terminates in a "synchronized way." It can
 * be re-activated. Re-activating it works using the same synchronization facility so that no two threads for this updater
 * are running at the same time.
