/**
 * Similar to {@link LowPointFirstToWinTwoRaces}, but three races are needed to win. If the regatta has one or more
 * medal series then in those medal series the wins are counted as the primary ordering criterion. If such a medal
 * series starts with a non-discardable carry column then the meaning of that column is changed to mean a number of wins
 * carried into the series. For example, in the 2024 Olympic kite format the winner of the opening series carries two
 * wins, the competitor ranking second at the end of the opening series one win into the grand final which is to be
 * represented as a second medal series following a first semi-final medal series; and boats ranking third and fourth
 * after the opening series carry two wins into the semi-final medal series, and boats ranking fifth and sixth after the
 * opening series carry one win each into the semi-final medal series.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Competitors that score in a later medal series are considered better than those that don't (promotion / elimination
 * scheme).
 * <p>
 * 
 * Those carried wins are added to the
 * {@link #isWin(Leaderboard, Competitor, RaceColumn, TimePoint, Function, WindLegTypeAndLegBearingAndORCPerformanceCurveCache)
 * wins} achieved in the medal series. More wins rank better. Equal numbers of races won make the score in the last race
 * in that series the first tie-breaker. Note that "last race" can be different races in case of multiple fleets in that
 * medal series, such as in a semi-final medal series split into fleets A and B. Should the tie not be resolved this
 * way, the next and last tie-breaking criterion is the opening series rank where the "opening series" is comprised of
 * all {@link Series} preceding any {@link Series#isMedal() medal series} and may itself consist of more than one
 * {@link Series} object, such as a "Qualification" and a "Final" series in case the fleet is split.
 * <p>
 * 
 * When a medal series is specified to {@link Series#isStartsWithZeroScore() start with zero scores} then this is also
 * applied to the number of wins counted so far. Therefore, if a second medal series follows a first medal series and
 * the second medal series has {@link Series#isStartsWithZeroScore()} set to {@code true} then the wins start counting
 * with zero, then a {@link Series#isFirstColumnNonDiscardableCarryForward() carry column} will be interpreted to hold
 * the number of wins carried into this series, and further wins will be added to that.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This scoring scheme changes the definition of the net points sum for all medal series participants to equal the
 * number of wins, considering the {@link Series#isStartsWithZeroScore()} and the wins carried over into the series as
 * specified by {@link Series#isFirstColumnNonDiscardableCarryForward()}.<p>
 * 
 * The penalty score calculation for an {@link MaxPointsReason#STP STP} IRM code is changed: instead of adding 1.0 to
 * the score from tracking, this scoring scheme adds 1.1. This shall help avoid ties, particularly when it comes to
 * deciding a race's winner which shall happen based on lowest score (<em>not</em> score equaling 1.0) now.

     * to distinguish between competitors who only sailed in the opening series (anything preceding the first medal
     * series), and those who did score in at least one medal race, because the medal series are evaluated only by wins
     * and as a secondary tie breaker then by the medal race scores looked at from the end, and after that the rank at
     * the end of the opening series.
     * <p>
     * 
     * It is safe to assume that if {@code o1} has valid medal series scores then so will {@code o2}, and vice versa,
     * because otherwise ranking by medal series participation would already have decided who ranks better. If none has
     * score in a medal race then we default to the {@code super} implementation with a default RRS A8.1 decision.
     * <p>
     * 
     * Otherwise (both have scored in at least one medal race) we have to assume that both sailed in the same medal
     * series, scored the same number of wins (including wins carried forward) and were also tied on the scores in their
     * respective last medal race. Then, the decision is to be made based on the opening series rank, which in itself
