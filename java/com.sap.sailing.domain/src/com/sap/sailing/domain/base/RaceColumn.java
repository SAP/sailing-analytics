/**
 * One or more races that would be noted together in a single column in a {@link Leaderboard}. If the number of
 * competitors of a regatta is too big to have a single start, the set of competitors can be split into several
 * {@link Fleet}s. Still, the regatta has a sequence of "races", only that each such "race" actually consists of several
 * individual races, each tracked separately, with a separate start and a separate field of competitors which are
 * distinct subsets of the regatta's competitors. These races are grouped in a {@link RaceColumn}. The
 * {@link RaceColumn} therefore provides access to the {@link TrackedRace}s by {@link Fleet} and by {@link Competitor}.
 * The {@link TrackedRace}s represent the data of a race. Over the life time of this object it can be assigned one or more
 * {@link TrackedRace}s which then act(s) as data provider to this column. If no tracked race has been assigned, the
 * scores reported by this column will all default to zero.<p>
 * 
 * A {@link RaceColumnListener} can be {@link #addRaceColumnListener added} to receive notifications about tracked races
 * being {@link #setTrackedRace(Fleet, TrackedRace) linked} to this column or unlinked from this column.
