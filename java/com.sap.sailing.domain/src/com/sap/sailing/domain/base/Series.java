/**
 * A series is a part of a {@link Regatta}. Series are ordered within the regatta, and rules for who is assigned to
 * which series may exist on the regatta. For example, a regatta may have a qualification series, a final series, and a
 * medal "series" with usually only a single medal race. Each series has one or more fleets, deciding how many races per
 * race column have to be run in this round. For example, if the 49er regatta has so many competitors that they cannot
 * all start in one race, the qualification series can be split into two {@link Fleet}s, "Yellow" and "Blue," each
 * getting their separate races. Fleet assignment may or may not vary. This usually depends on the series'
 * characteristics of having ordered or unordered fleets.<p>
 *
 * A series may define its result discarding scheme. If it does, a regatta leaderboard for the containing regatta
 * has to adhere to this and may not define its own cross-cutting result discarding scheme. If one or more series
 * in the regatta choose to define their own result discarding scheme, discards are determined per series and not
 * per leaderboard.<p>
 *
 * To receive notifications when {@link TrackedRace tracked races} are linked to or unlinked from any of this series'
 * columns, {@link RaceColumnListener}s can be added / removed.
