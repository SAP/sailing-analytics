/**
 * Can filter {@link DynamicGPSFixTrack} contents for fixes that seem inconsistent in their timing. The underlying
 * hypothesis is that some fix sources, such as the "Sail Insight" app, may have issues that every now and then
 * produce a fix that has an incorrect time stamp but a valid and plausible position. While one may think that
 * in such cases a constant offset should be observed between the implausible and probable fixes, reality suggests
 * that the offsets are sometimes random.<p>
 * 
 * The filter looks for several indicators for inconsistencies, such as unusual sampling times that don't seem to fit
 * the overall frequency at which fixes usually arrive; also, inconsistencies between COG/SOG reported and inferred
 * from neighbor fix positions are a good indication for fixes with incorrect timing; lastly, a timing inconsistency
 * is considered more probable if a time offset exists that brings the fix fairly close to the segments of the remaining
 * track.<p>
 * 
 * Use {@link #findAndRemoveInconsistenciesOnRawFixes(DynamicGPSFixTrack)} to obtain a replaced {@link DynamicGPSFixTrack}
 * together with the number of inconsistencies found. The original track will not be changed by this operation.

     * On {@link #track} looks at adjacent fixes and compares the COG/SOG values reported by those fixes with the
     * COG/SOG value inferred from their position and time delta.
     * <p>
     * 
     * Hypothesis: we have a fix sequence that describes the trajectory of a sailing boat where some of the fixes have
     * an incorrect time point. The offset of these incorrect time points varies. In the particular case observed, all
     * regular fixes have a time point that is at a full second (UTC) with zero milliseconds, whereas all outliers have
     * a non-zero millisecond part that does not fit the otherwise very regular sampling rate.
     * <p>
     * 
     * Due to the irregularity of the offsets there is no point in trying to "learn" this offset. Instead, it's more
     * about recognizing the outliers which so far always seem to come as a single fix in a longer series of regular
     * fixes, and then finding a good time point adjustment so it matches the sequence.
     * <p>
     * 
     * With this in mind we would always have to look "both ways," trying to find out whether the fix originally had an
     * earlier or a later time point that would bring it closely in line with the other fixes. The fix does contain
     * valuable information despite its incorrect time point because it could indicate a deviation from the straight
     * line otherwise connecting the two adjacent fixes.
     * <p>
     * 
     * To approximate the correct time point we look for the track segment closest to the fix's position, then project
     * the fix onto it and split the segment's duration proportionately.
     * <p>
     * 
     * @return the number of inconsistencies found on the {@code track} passed, as well as a replacement track that has
     *         the outliers found adjusted
