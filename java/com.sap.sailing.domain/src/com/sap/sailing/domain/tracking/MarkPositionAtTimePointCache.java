/**
 * Some calculations that span several method calls require access to the same {@link Mark} positions for the same
 * {@link TimePoint} within the scope of the same {@link TrackedRace} repeatedly. Usually, for such a compound
 * calculation it doesn't matter whether a new fix has arrived in between, making it valid to cache the mark
 * positions---once calculated---for the remainder of the compound operation. Based on these positions, approximate
 * waypoint positions and leg bearings can also be calculated and cached.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Implementations of this interface may cache the results of computing a mark's position for the duration of this
