/**
 * Centerpiece of a tracking adapter. A tracker is responsible for receiving tracking data for one or more
 * {@link RaceDefinition races} that are {@link Regatta#getAllRaces() part of} a common {@link #getRegatta() Event}. Some
 * tracker architectures may not be able to deliver all data for the {@link RaceDefinition} when created or started.
 * Therefore, {@link #getRace()} may return <code>null</code> if the race information hasn't been received by the
 * tracker yet. Through the {@link RaceHandle} returned by {@link #getRaceHandle()} it is also possible to perform a
 * {@link RaceHandle#getRace() blocking get} for the race tracked by this tracker.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The data received by the tracker is usually fed into {@link TrackedRace} objects that {@link TrackedRace#getRace()
 * correspond} to the {@link RaceDefinition} objects for whose tracking this tracker is responsible. When the
 * {@link TrackedRace} isn't connected to its {@link TrackedRegatta#getTrackedRaces() owning} {@link TrackedRegatta}, a
 * tracker is assumed to no longer update the {@link TrackedRace} object, even if it hasn't been {@link #stop(boolean) stopped}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A tracker may be {@link #stop(boolean) stopped}. In this case, it will no longer receive any data at all. Stopping a tracker
 * will not modify the {@link Regatta} and the {@link TrackedRegatta} with regards to their ownership of their
 * {@link RaceDefiniion} and {@link TrackedRace}, respectively.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A {@link RaceTracker} controls the lifecycle of a {@link TrackedRace} in contrast to a {@link TrackingDataLoader} which just
 * contributes to the composite status but does not control the lifecycle.
