/**
 * Compares two competitors by their ranking in the overall race for a given time point. Competitors who haven't started
 * the first leg are all equally ranked last. Competitors in different legs are ranked by inverse leg index: the higher
 * the number of the leg the lesser (better) the rank. Competitors in the same leg are ranked by their windward distance
 * to go in that leg, requiring wind data or estimates to be available for the given time point. The wind is estimated at
 * the middle of the leg for consistent ordering, so the same wind data will be used for comparing all competitors in the
 * same leg at a given point in time.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This comparator assumes that the race's {@link Course} remains unchanged from the time this comparator's constructor
 * is invoked and the last call to {@link #compare(Competitor, Competitor)} on this comparator. This should be obvious
 * because course changes have an effect on the race's leg structure and therefore on the foundations for ranking.
 * Clients should use {@link Course#lockForRead()} and {@link Course#unlockAfterRead()} to frame the construction and
 * use of this comparator.<p>
 * 
 * Two different competitors may end up being ranked equal by this comparator. So take care and don't use this
 * comparator class when inserting into an {@link SortedSet} when you want something like a ranking. It may overwrite
 * existing entries. Use {@link Collections#sort(java.util.List, Comparator)} instead.
