/**
 * Evaluates a {@link Competitor}'s ranking metric, e.g., based on the windward distance to overall leader in case of a
 * one-design class or according to some handicapping scheme given different competitors in the race different time
 * allowances based on distance traveled or time spent. The metric produces a {@link Comparable} value of type
 * <code>T</code> which can be used to order competitors by rank. A {@link Comparator} can be acquired from this metric
 * that handles the calculation and caching of these values for a given race (or for a given leg) and time point so that
 * during sorting a competitor collection the expensive calculations don't need to be carried out redundantly.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Furthermore, this metric knows how to evaluate a {@link Competitor}'s corrected time and how to compute the windward
 * distance to another competitor, both, on a per-leg basis as well as for the entire race.
 * <p>
 * 
 * A handicap-based metric may need to request specific parameters from the {@link Competitor} to judge the ranking
 * correctly, such as the time-on-time multiplier, the Yardstick number, the time-on-distance allowance or the complex
 * ORC Performance Curve rating.
