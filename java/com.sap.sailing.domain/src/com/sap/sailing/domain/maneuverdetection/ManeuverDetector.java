/**
 * Determines maneuvers performed within a tracked race by competitor associated with this
 * {@link ManeuverDetector}-instance. The steps of maneuver detection look as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Douglas-Peucker-fixes set is determined for the GPS-track of competitor. The analyzed GPS-fixes set gets limited
 * by the set contained between the time points of crossing start line and finish-line. The limit does not apply if no
 * start-line has been crossed by the competitor at all. In case of absent crossing of finish-line, the GPS-fix set gets
 * analyzed until the last available GPS-fix.</li>
 * <li>The bearings between DP-fixes are calculated</li>
 * <li>Consecutive DP-fixes get grouped together if their sign of associated bearing is equal and the duration and
 * distance limits between DP-fixes is satisfied.</li>
 * <li>For each DP-fixes group a {@link CompleteManeuverCurve} gets determined</li>
 * <li>For each {@link CompleteManeuverCurve}-instance appropriate {@link Maneuver}-instance(s) are determined. In
 * contrast to maneuvers, the complete maneuver curves are not subject to any splitting logic for maneuvers with
 * multiple "tacking" and "jibing".</li>
