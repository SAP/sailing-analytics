/**
 * The {@link RaceBoardEntryPoint} implements a versatile race viewer perspective that comes with a leaderboard, charts
 * and a central map component. Through various options, this viewer and its components can be configured in various
 * ways, making it a powerful and flexible tool. In order to simplify usage for specific anticipated scenarios,
 * a {@link RaceBoardMode} implements a strategy for pre-configuring the various settings and component states
 * in a way useful for that particular scenario. For example, a "start analysis" mode would adjust the
 * {@link LeaderboardSettings} such that the columns making relevant statements about the start are shown
 * whereas others are suppressed; the timer would be set to the time of the race start, and the competitor chart
 * would be shown, with speed over ground as the metric selected and the top three boats selected.<p>
