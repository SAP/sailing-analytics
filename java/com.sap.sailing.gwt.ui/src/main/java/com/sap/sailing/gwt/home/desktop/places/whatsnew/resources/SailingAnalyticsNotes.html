        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2018</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>In <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> the availability of media is now visualized under the time slider via a bar overlay. When hovering the bar, the title of the video is shown.</li>
           <li>In <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> video players are now ensured to be on top of all video players when clicking/touching them.
               This means you can bring a specific video window in the foreground in case there are multiple ones that overlap each other.</li>
           <li>The filter selection in <tt>DataMining.html</tt> has been overhauled.
              <ul class="bulletList">
                 <li>All available filter dimensions are now listed where the different data retriever levels have been listed previously.
                     The different dimensions are divided by the corresponding data retriever level and can be filtered with the input
                     field above the list. Both the dimension and data retriever level names can be used to filter the dimension list.
                 </li>
                 <li>Selecting a filter dimension adds a table containing the available values of the selected dimension. The order of
                     the value tables is equal to the order of the dimensions list.
                 </li>
                 <li>Note that the selection of the filter dimensions follows the <q>table with checkbox column</q> pattern. So simply clicking on a
                     dimension will result in deselecting all previously selected dimensions, removing possible filter values. Clicking on the
                     checkbox column or using <q>ctrl+click</q> is advised.
                 </li>
                 <li>Each filter value table now has its own scroll-bar.</li>
              </ul>
           </li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2018</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>In the raceboard a new maneuver table has been added next to the wind and competitor charts.
               It shows the detected maneuvers of selected competitors which can be filtered by type via the respective 
               settings dialog. Also, the table entries can be sorted by clicking the column headers.
               During replay of finished races, clicking a maneuver will skip to the beginning of the maneuver.
               In case of a live race, the maneuver table will progressively fill with more data, as it becomes available.
           </li>
           <li>The size of the start count down shown near the start line on the map can now be adjusted in the map settings.</li>
           <li>The advantage line is now displayed in orange color which makes it easier to see on blue water.</li>
           <li>A problem with the mark passing calculation for smart phone-tracked races has been solved. This
               should avoid cases where automatic split time re-calculation sometimes stops for a race.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2018</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The data source and key figure selection of the <tt>DataMining.html</tt> have been simplified into a single
               input field widget.
           </li>
           <li>The key figure selection can now be searched and filtered with keywords by typing in the new selection widget.</li>
           <li>Zooming in on a competitor chart in the race viewer will now adjust the
               time resolution to that selected in the settings if before zooming the
               resolution had to be reduced to remain under the limit of data points that
               can be requested from the server in one round trip.
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2018</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Coordinate display (lat/lng), e.g., in pop-ups for marks and wind sensors
               now show the more common DDÂ°MM.MMM' format.
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">November 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The language preference set in the user profile (if any), now also affects the website's language. Formerly,
               this preference affected the language of notification mails only.
               Be aware of the fact, that signing in will not force the page to be shown in the user's preferred language.
               It will only take effect when refreshing the page manually or opening a new one, in order to prevent the
               state of the currently opened page to get lost.
               After a sign out (and another page reload) the language preference will stop to take effect.
           </li>
           <li>There are additional column types in the leaderboard that show per leg, per race and overall statistics
               for distance foiled and duration foiled. This allows for quick competitor comparisons regarding these
               figures which are so important for any foiling boat class. Note, that this feature is also available
               on overall leaderboards, providing foiling stats across an entire season or event series.
           </li>
           <li>When a leaderboard belongs to a leaderboard group with an overall (series) leaderboard and the
               leaderboard has no scores at all yet for a competitor, that competitor won't be assigned a score
               in the overall (series) leaderboard either. This way, when an act or event has its leaderboard already
               linked to the series leaderboard group, no scores will show in the series leaderboard before the
               act/event starts producing scores for the competitors.
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">October 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The <tt>DataMining.html</tt> module now offers an additional chart type with error bars. This currently
               shows minimum and maximum values for averages, and the tool tip visualizes those numerically, together
               with the number of elements from which the average was drawn.
           </li>
           <li>The <tt>DataMining.html</tt> module now reacts on clicks on bars in the result chart and triggers
               a corresponding drill-down operation, adding the first grouping key value as a new filter and removing
               the grouping dimension. If that was the last dimension removed, the user is asked to provide a new
               grouping dimension.
           </li>
           <li>If available, an event description is now shown on event overview pages.
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">September 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The system will now detect "anniversary races" and show those on the start page.
               Anniversary races are detected based on the total number of tracked races known (races having GPS data and a valid start date).
               Anniversary types currently known are round quarters like 10'000, 25'000, and 50'000 as well as numbers where all digits are the same like 11'111 or 22'222.
               Some time before such a milestone is reached, a countdown is shown on the start page. When an anniversary is reached, the determined race is shown at the same place.
           </li>
           <li>Users that aren't authenticated will now see a message near the login icon in the page header.
               This message gently hints about additional functionality being available for authenticated users.
               This message lets you show details the additional functionality being available for authenticated users only.
               When either logging in, showing details or dismissing this message, the message will disappear for some days until it reappears.
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>In the list of past events, you can now find some statistics for the current and past years.
               The statistics can be found at the end of the list of events for a year.
               To see statistics of a past year, you need to expand the list of events for that year.
           </li>
           <li>The simulation overlay is now also available prior to the start of a live race. It can
               therefore, e.g., be used to "predict" the best course on the first upwind leg based on
               the latest wind measurements.
           </li>
           <li>In several places you can now find statistics regarding the highest speed and the competitor that produced it (fastest competitor).
               These statistics are available for events and regattas as well as in the yearly statistics.
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>When using Smartphone Tracking, mark positions obtained by pinging or tracking or manually
               assigning a static position can now be removed using the "Delete Fix" pop-up menu item
               in the Mark Position Editor. It will require removing and re-tracking the race to make
               the removal take effect.
           </li>
           <li>In <code>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</code> it's now possible to display an overlay that shows
               the estimated duration based on the course and the current wind conditions. To show this information,
               you need to select the respective option in the map's settings dialog. The option's visibility
               depends on the availability of sufficient polar data for the boat class.
           </li>
           <li>In <code>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</code> it isn't possible anymore to select other races to be shown in the embedded leaderboard.
               This possibility caused several problems in the past. The leaderboard will now always stick to the single race for which the raceboard was opened.
           </li>
           <li>The autoplay sites have been re-implemented from ground up:
               <ul>
                    <li>Autoplay now uses the new settings framework</li>
                    <li>Classic-Autoplay represents the old autoplay  </li>
                    <li>Sixty-Inch-Autoplay is a new, more complex, redesigned,  multiview autoplay targeted at big screen displays</li>
               </ul> 
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Several improvements were implemented regarding user settings:
               <ul>
                    <li>Document settings are saved as delta to the user defaults instead of the delta to the system defaults.
                        In cases where a setting has the value 'A' as system default and 'B' as user default, it's now possible to set it back to 'A' for a document.
                        Settings stored before this change will continue to work with the old overwriting semantic.</li>
                    <li>Collection based settings are now stored as delta to the default set of values. This means that removals and additions are being recorded instead of all values of a setting.
                        Having value 'A' as system default and adding 'B' for the user default and 'C' for one document will select values 'A', 'B' and 'C' for the document.</li>
                    <li>Settings dialogs now have a 'reset to default' button. When pressing this button, user defaults as well as the current document settings are being reset to the system defaults.
                        In addition, the settings dialog is updated to show the system defaults. Those defaults will only take effect for the current view when pressing ok.</li>
                    <li>User settings can now also be saved for <code>/gwt/RaceBoard.html</code>. Be aware that different modes have distinct settings so that defaults defined for one mode do not have any effect on other modes.</li>
                    <li>On the user profile page you can now find a list of all stored settings. You can show the technical settings data and remove specific setting entries.</li>
               </ul>
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>It's now possible to show nationality flags in addition to competitor images in leaderboards if both are available.
               If no competitor images are available, this won't have any effect.
               You can activate this option through the leaderboard settings dialog to be found in various views.
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>Several pages are now enabled to save user settings with the following specifics:
               <ul>
                    <li>In settings dialogs there is a "Make default" button in the lower-left corner which is displayed when saving of settings is enabled. A click on that
                        button causes the system to use the new settings as default values for the same page. This is independent of a race, event or leaderboard to be shown.</li>
                    <li>A click on OK button causes the system to store the settings as document settings. Document settings are only used for the same event, leaderboard or race.
                        When the page is opened for e.g. the same race, the settings used last time are loaded.</li>
                    <li>Settings saved this way are stored locally in the browser's local storage and in the user profile if you are logged in.</li>
                    <li>Settings can be overwritten by URL parameters.</li>
               </ul>
               The following pages are now enabled to provide user settings:
               <ul>
                    <li><code>/gwt/Leaderboard.html</code></li>
                    <li><code>/gwt/RegattaOverview.html</code></li>
                    <li>Leaderboards embedded in <code>/gwt/Home.html</code></li>
               </ul>
               This feature required changing several URL parameters, which means that previously saved bookmarks might work slightly different.
           </li>
           <li>The maneuver loss calculation for penalty circles has been improved. Previously, the end of the
               penalty circle maneuver was considered to be at the last of the two adjacent tack/gybe maneuvers.
               This, usually, is earlier than when approaching the course over ground at the beginning of the
               penalty circle again. With this, the extrapolation of the speed/course at the beginning of
               the maneuver did not last long enough. Furthermore, penalties with strong accelerations during
               the gybing phase could have led to an incorrect inference of the speed and course at the
               beginning of the maneuver. Both of these issues have now been fixed, leading to good results
               also in very specific and unusual speed developments during a penalty circle maneuver.
           </li>
           <li>The advantage line display has been fixed for legs changing their type (upwind/downwind/reach)
               while the race is going on. It now uses the leg type at the same current time point that the
               leaderboard uses for calculating the competitor ranking.
           </li>
           <li>Images in the overall image gallery ("Photographers love Sailing") are now linked with the
               events to which they belong. Clicking the image navigates to the event page.
           </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The SAP Sailing Analytics are now also available in French, Portugese, as well as Spanish.
               Find the language chooser in the lower right corner of the footer, or when signed in, go to your user
               profile and set your preferred language.
           </li>
           <li>The application's locale now switches based on the client's "Accept-Language" HTTP header field.
               This means that the application in all its parts will show in the user's default language if
               supported, defaulting to English otherwise.
           </li>
        </ul>    
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The definition of "ride height" for foiling sensors has been changed. Instead of showing
               the ride height calculated by the sensor we are now showing the minimum of the port and
               starboard ride heights. Therefore, this new definition of ride height can be seen as the
               distance of lowest hull part from the water.
           </li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2017</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>An issue with wind-up map rotation which sometimes left the map centered over the African continent has been fixed.
           </li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">October 2016</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>An issue with live re-calculation of the maximum speed over ground (SOG) values has been fixed.
               In some circumstances it was possible that new live data did not properly update the MaxSOG figures.
               Since this depended on the timing of read and write access it could have led to different values
               for different server instances, giving confusing results. The fix provided now ensures that
               the MaxSOG values are properly evaluated when new data has arrived.  
           </li>
           <li>The buoy zone radius is now determined by a configurable regatta property. By default, it is
               set to two hull lengths, and a regatta administrator may choose to change it to any other factor
               such as 3 or 2.5. This determines the default used in the race viewer (RaceBoard.html). Users can
               still change the radius in the map settings to any arbitrary number, deviating from what has
               "officially" been set for the regatta.
           </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2016</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>In order to prepare user-specific configuration support in additional parts of the application,
               various modules now require a user account to be accessed. Please sign up and log in to use their
               full functionality as usual. The following modules are affected:
               <ul>
                    <li><tt>/gwt/Simulator.html</tt></li>
                    <li><tt>/gwt/DataMining.html</tt></li>

        <ul class="bulletList">
           <li>The Wind arrow in the top left corner of the race map / player now serves as a toggle button
               for the wind streamlet overlay which can still also be reached through the map settings.
           </li>
           <li>If you want to analyze a race, the navigation slightly changed. The button, which is shown for tracked
               races won't lead you to the race board directly, but provides a small menu. There you can choose from
               several pre-defined analysis, which will launch the race board with respective configurations:
               <ul>
               <li>Replay/Watch live: Launches race board in play mode starting at race start, if race is already
                   finished (Replay) or at the actual time, if the race is currently live (Watch live)
               </li>
               <li>Race analysis: Shows the race results by setting the timer to the end of the race.
                   <i>This option is only available, if the race is already finished.</i>
               </li>
               <li>Start analysis: Shows the race start 10 sec after start and shows the speed over ground (SOG) of
                   the best starters within the competitor chart (zoomed to start).
                   <i>This option is only available, if the race is already started.</i>
               </li>
               <li>Winning lanes: Shows the full lanes of the best competitor, if race is already finished or the of
                   leading competitors if the race is currently live.
               </li>
               </ul>
           </li>
           <li>On the user profile page you now can maintain a list of you favorite boat classes and competitors.
               You can also opt in for notification mails about your favorites to stay informed.
               A requirement for notification mails to work for you is that you entered a valid mail address
               to your user profile and verified the address by clicking the link that has been sent via email.
           </li>

		    <li>Fixed a bug in the wind streamlet visualization. Now the wind streamlets
		        correctly show the wind at the location selected also in wind-up mode.
		    </li>
		    <li>Added the "Course Geometry" option to the map display. With this option selected,
		        the map will show an info text for each leg and the start and finish line (only
		        for one of start/finish line if they are identical), telling the length of the leg

		        to display the club flags consistently when all nation flags would be the same anyway.
		    </li>
		    <li>The wind estimation from the tracked courses over ground has been improved. It now takes into
		        account any polar data available for the boat class concerned. In particular, this helps to rule
		        out very unlikely gybing angles in downwind clusters that otherwise could have led to an incorrect
		        split of the downwind fleet into two clusters where actually all boats were on the same tack.
		    </li>
		    <li>Some significant improvements have been applied to the simulator feature which is embedded in the
		        race viewer since some time now. The simulator now copes with very shifty wind conditions and finds
		        solutions in scenarios where an upwind leg flips to a reach or even into a downwind leg over time.

		   	out. Furthermore, you will not be able to use the Satellite view with this setting. Tip:
		   	if you want to re-align to wind-up after a major wind shift, un-check the setting, confirm
		   	the setting change, then set it again. A compass shows the true north orientation. Clicking
		   	the compass will toggle between wind-up and north-up display.

		    <li>Bug fix for cumulative points in the leaderboard ("Show added scores for each entry in leaderboard").
		        With this setting, scores of competitors not tracked in the current race were not correctly represented

		        leg. To still make distances comparable, a new metric has been introduced that for a gate
		        start adds the distance between the port side of the start line and the position where
		        the competitor started to the distance sailed in the first leg.
		    </li>
		    <li>The weights of the wind measurement units, the wind estimation and manual wind inputs by the
		        race committee are now used properly for the wind streamlet visualization. This fixes issues
		        with exaggerated weights for an estimated wind direction of very low confidence.

		        except for port starts which may have to be considered differently. For gate starts, you can use
		        this measure to find out about early and late starters and dig into possible correlations between

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">

			This feature becomes particularly interesting when combined with the "Show wind streamlets overlay"
			feature that visualizes the spatial distribution of the wind field over the course.
		    </li>
		    <li>The race viewer is now more resilient against exceptional conditions such as the missing
		        of all wind information and the missing of a course with its waypoints. If no wind information
			is available at all (no wind direction indicator is then shown in the upper left corner of
			the map) then all ranking and distances will be based on a projection onto the course instead
			of onto the wind direction, even for upwind and downwind legs.

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>The 2D race viewer, also known as the "Race Board," now comes with a fresh, new design. The orange
		        checkbox toggle buttons that open or close views such as the leaderboard or the charts for wind
		        and competitor comparison, have been replaced by tabs with "&gt;&gt;" symbols. Clicking on those
		        will expand or collapse the respective view. The views can now be resized using the handles attached
		        to the dividers separating the views. They work much better on mobile and touch devices than the splitters
		        used previously did. The settings buttons that used to be integrated with the orange toggle
		        checkbox buttons have now been moved into the views that they control. For example, the map settings
		        button is now displayed on the map, below the zoom control on the right map border.
		    </li>
		    <li>The leaderboard now has an improved search and filter control. Above the table displaying the
		        competitors and their figures is a new field with a text input that you can use to filter for
		        competitors, by their sail number or their name. While filtered, use the checkboxes in front of
		        the table row to add the competitor to or remove it from the selection. Use the "X" button to the
		        right of the search input field to clear the search. To the left of the search input field is a
		        filter symbol that you can use to select and create advanced filtering rules, such as filtering
		        by rank or nationality. Left of the filter button is the leaderboard settings button.
		    </li>
			<li>The leaderboard has a new first column: a selection check box. We hope this makes it easier in
			    particular for users on mobile or other touch devices to select more than one competitor at a time.
			    The old-style multi-selection using the Control and Shift keys, as known well from typical desktop
			    file explorers, still work like they did before. Note that it is possible to sort for the checkbox
			    column, putting the selected competitors at the top of the leaderboard.
			</li>
			<li>When using the auto-zoom feature from the map settings, boats and wind streamlets will now
			    continue to move smoothly as long as the map only needs panning. Please also note that auto-zooming
			    to "tails" may slow down the display considerable, particularly when tracking at high frequency.
			</li>
	        <li>When viewing a single race, the leaderboard now by default does no longer show the regatta rank as
			    the first column (and not as the second one either, given that the first column now usually shows
			    the checkboxes used for selecting items). If you'd like to get the regatta rank column back, also when
			    looking at a single race, please choose it from the leaderboard settings dialog where you can find it
			    in the "Overall Details" section. It may still be a nice column to have when following the last race
			    in a regatta. If you're just interested in the relative regatta rank ordering you may as well sort by
			    the right-most total points column which (surprising to some but welcome by most) sorts by the regatta
			    rank and not by the plain points sum (taking into account medal race and gold/silver/... fleet participations).

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>The advantage line now uses the wind at the position in the middle of the leg that the
			    competitor to which the line is attached is currently sailing in. Before, the "global" wind
			    average was used which is still displayed in the top left corner of the map. You can understand
			    the details by turning on the "Streamlet" wind visualization in the Map Settings.
			</li>
			<li>Faster wind streamlet loading: when you activate the streamlets for wind visualization, they now
			    display much faster.
			</li>
			<li>Faster boat position display: We found that what you're probably the most interested in when
			    you first open a race map or move the time slider to some very different point in time is the
			    position of the boats at that point in time; and you want to know it fast.
			    The tails which show how the boats got there are also interesting, but you won't blame us as much
			    if it takes a little bit to update them. So we've separated the placement of the boats from the
			    drawing of their tails. Now you may blame us for the tails temporarily not being attached to the
			    boats anymore ;-).

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>In the "Maps" settings in the RaceBoard page there is a new checkbox named
			    "Show wind streamlets overlay." If you select it and wait for about a minute,
			    a complete wind field will be calculated and visualized as an overlay on top
			    of the race course display. It reacts to you moving the time slider and shows
			    how the wind differs at different locations on the course. Stronger and faster-moving
			    streamlets mean stronger breeze.
			</li>
			<li>Wind is now calculated location-based. At locations closer to a sensor, that sensor
			    has a higher influence on the local wind field than sensors further away. The wind
			    estimations based on the courses sailed are assigned a location that corresponds with
			    the "center of gravity" of the field that was used for the estimation. For example,
			    if the fleet is approaching the windward mark and the wind sensor in on the committee
			    boat on the leeward side of the course, the course-based estimation influences the
			    assumed wind field more on the windward side whereas the sensor counts more for
			    the leeward side.
			</li>
			<li>Switched to the latest version of the Highcharts charting framework. This leads to improvements
			    especially on mobile devices. Charts can be zoomed using pinch gestures now.
			</li>
			<li>To support the use of the SAP Sailing Analytics also for live video streaming formats, we
			    introduced a new URL parameter <tt>viewShowMapControls</tt> for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt>
			    and the <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> pages. Setting this parameter to "false"
			    will suppress the zoom, pan and map type selection
			    controls on the map display. Example:
			    <a href="http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false">http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false</a>.
			    When used for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt> URL, this will apply
			    to all <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> pages (all races) reached from there. Of course, the map
			    can still be panned and zoomed using the usual mouse gestures. A left double click zooms
			    in, a right double click zooms out. Zoom can also be controlled using the mouse wheel.
			    And panning works by clicking on the map and dragging the mouse. Without the map type
			    control, switching to satellite view is not possible (keep this in mind when tracking
			    races in China, see below for Google's random coordinate transformations there).
			</li>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Fixed an issue with the wind speed charts. Charts that only had a single, unchanged
			    wind speed crashed the browser. The solution scales the right hand side Y-axis denoting
			    the wind speed such that it always starts at 0kts.
			</li> 
			<li>Analysis of tacks and jibes around mark passings has now been improved. Before,
			    a jibe followed by a tack that turns in the same direction (e.g., to port) so far
			    was always called a penalty maneuver. Now, if a mark passing separates such a tack
			    from such a jibe, no penalty is called anymore, and the two maneuvers are identified
			    correctly.
			</li>
			<li>Another note on maneuver analysis: we received questions regarding the maneuvers
			    involved in clearing an OCS. The SAP Sailing Analytics treat a clearing of
			    an OCS, going back behind the start line and crossing it again, as if the competitor
			    started again. In particular this means that all maneuvers prior to this new start
			    do not count for the metrics; neither does the distance sailed between the first (OCS)
			    start and the clear start.
			</li>
			<li>A hint regarding the "distance to start line" metrics: please keep in mind that currently this
			    measurement is calculated as the distance of the GPS tracker from the line. Unless the tracker
			    is mounted near the bow (or at the bow sprit, if any), the distance calculated this way will
			    be greater than what counts for crossing the line. Ordering, comparing and aggregating over this
			    figure still makes sense as long as you remember this detail.
			</li>
			<li>Introduced a new leaderboard entry "XTE +/-" featuring a signed cross-track error which shows
			    for a leg and also aggregated for an entire race on which side of the leg a competitor stayed on
			    average. Currently, the "side" is defined as viewing in the leg's direction, so "left" for a downwind
			    leg is the same side as "right" for the corresponding upwind leg.

			<li>China races, such as in Qingdao, may have the map background displayed at slightly wrong locations.

			    correctly. <img src="/images/mapsatellite.png"/>
			</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that in some cases has caused the wind chart, the advantage line, the wind indicator on the map
			    and the leaderboard to use slightly different wind values. The problem was related to different averaging and
			    damping methods used for these values which has now been aligned.
			</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that caused the time spent in a leg, race or regatta to always show the time at the end of the leg
			    if the leg has been started by the competitor at the time point queried, e.g., by the time slider. While this
			    did not have any serious effects in live mode, for replay races this left the leg time and race time constant
				at the total time spent so far up to the end of the last leg the competitor had started at that time.

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Added a new setting for a leaderboard called "Show added scores". Using this feature one
			can display added scores for each leaderboard entry. An added score is the sum over all scores
			from the first column to the current column. One can describe it as an intermediate overall score.
			This feature can be used to know the score until a specific race while another race is live and
			constantly changes the overall score.</li>
			
			<li>Added tooltips for leaderboard settings.</li>
			
			<li>Fixed HighPointOverall scheme to also break a tie by looking at the ranks of the last regatta.</li>

			<li>Progress indicator when expanding a race in the RaceBoard view</li>

			<li>Leaderboard column "GPS Lag" shows how far a competitor's GPS signal lags behind the average
			    tracking quality. A background color bar classifies into good/ok/bad (green/yellow/red).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Fixed an issue with boat rotation on Safari browsers</li>

			<li>Maneuver analysis now counts tacks and jibes based on wind
			    at boat position and not based on leg type; subsequently,
			    penalty circle analysis is now based on a tack and a jibe
			    in close succession instead of a full circle.</li>

			<li>Regatta rank and overall rank in competitor chart of leaderboard panel
			    has been fixed; it did erroneously display the rank of the particular
			    race, not the regatta/overall rank after that race.</li>

			<li>Regatta overview now also displays all regatta leaderboards</li>

			<li>Boat colors match tail colors</li>
			
			<li>When selecting boats in leaderboard, de-selected boats' tails turn grey</li>

		</ul>


		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Boat movement animated smoothly</li>

			<li>Start and Finish line show line parameters (length, angle to wind,
		advantage) when mouse hovers over them</li>

			<li>Start line has a count-down indicator displayed next to it
		before the start. The count-down is also displayed underneath the time
		slider</li>

			<li>Competitor and Wind charts show pre-start data where possible</li>

			<li>Competitors can be assigned a fixed color which they will keep
		for all races in a regatta</li>

			<li>By default, videos are now shown in a moveable, resizable box embedded in
		the web page. For a two screen setup, the embedded box can be popped out to a
		dedicated browser window.</li>

			<li>Official score corrections for historic races are only applied after
		the respective competitor finished the race. Therefore, in-between race
		scores now correspond with tracking, regardless of final corrected score.</li>
		
		    <li>By using negative playback speed (e.g., -1), replays can be run backwards.</li>
