/**
 * The class is used together with the {@link ParallelExecutionHolder} when two or more asynchronous service calls
 * should run in parallel and only in case all of them have been executed successfully the next action makes sense.
 * Instances of this class are first created, then passed to a
 * {@link ParallelExecutionHolder#ParallelExecutionHolder(ParallelExecutionCallback...)} constructor and can then be
 * passed as callbacks to GWT RPC method invocations like the regular {@link AsyncCallback} and may also be wrapped by
 * {@link MarkedAsyncCallback} objects. The {@link #onSuccess(Object)} method tells the {@link ParallelExecutionHolder}
 * to which this callback is submitted that the call succeeded. If that was the last outstanding callback then the
 * {@link ParallelExecutionHolder} will subsequently invoke its {@link ParallelExecutionHolder#handleSuccess()} method.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Should this callback receive an {@link #onFailure(Throwable)} call then the
 * {@link ParallelExecutionHolder#handleFailure(Throwable)} method will be called. When this happens for at least one of
 * the callbacks registered with the {@link ParallelExecutionHolder} then the
 * {@link ParallelExecutionHolder#handleSuccess()} method will not be called.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In case of subclassing and overriding this class's default implementations of {@link #onSuccess(Object)} the subclass
 * implementation must invoke {@code super.onSuccess(t)} at some point during method execution.
