/**
 * <p>Decorator for asynchronous remote procedure calls which should be marked as pending until they complete.
 *   Such calls will be marked using a counter, which is necessary in UI tests to be able able to tell exactly when an
 *   asynchronous request has finished. With this counter a test which triggers a request (which can cause additional
 *   request) can wait until the requests have finished. It's guaranteed that the counter is decremented no matter if
 *   the call was successful or not.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note: Since the counter for pending Ajax requests is incremented as soon as an instance of this class is created
 *   you must not create instances of this class which are not used or assigned to an field for multiple uses!</p>
 * 
 * @param <T>
 *   The type of the return value for the asynchronous remote procedure call.
