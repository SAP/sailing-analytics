orcPerformanceCurveRankingMetricDescription=ORC Performance Curve: Sophisticated handicapping scheme that awards time allowances based on a VPP/polar assuming pre-defined legs'' angles to the wind;\nbased on these allowances, an "implied wind" is calculated which is the basis for ranking.\nImplied wind can be calculated at any time in the race and is therefore the basis for in-race ranking. 
timeOnTimeAndDistanceRankingMetricDescription=Time-on-Time / Time-on-Distance: Final ranking by calculated time;\ntime is calculated by optionally applying a factor to the actual time (defaulting to 1.0)\nand subtracting an allowance in seconds per nautical mile,\napplied to the course length.\nIn-race ranks based on expected arrival at fastest boat's current position\nassuming current leg's average VMG/VMC.
