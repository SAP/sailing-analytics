\ In addition if the competitor count is unequal to the registered competitor count in the actual leaderboard, the pairing list cannot be applied to Race logs. \
\ The count of the flights that is used to generate a pairing list is defined by the number of flights in the leaderboard that are not medal races. \
\ When using flight repeats, flight assignments can be repeated (e.g. 15 flights with 3 flight repeats: 5 unique flight assignments and each one will be repeated 3 times). \
\ A boat change factor equals 0 leads to a well distributed assignment of competitors to boats whereas the maximum (number of flights) leads to fewer boat changes by raising chances that a competitor sails the same boat for two contiguous races across a flight boundary.

orcPerformanceCurveRankingMetricDescription=ORC Performance Curve: Sophisticated handicapping scheme that awards time allowances based on a VPP/polar assuming pre-defined legs'' angles to the wind;\nthe greatest implied wind value is determined; all boats are ranked by mapping this greatest implied wind to their performance curves, determining their allowance for that implied wind\nand then computing the delta to their elapsed time. Total calculated time is computed using the elapsed time of the boat with the least GPH as baseline.
orcPerformanceCurveByImpliedWindRankingMetricDescription=ORC Performance Curve: Sophisticated handicapping scheme that awards time allowances based on a VPP/polar assuming pre-defined legs'' angles to the wind;\nbased on these allowances, an "implied wind" is calculated which is the basis for ranking.\nImplied wind can be calculated at any time in the race and is therefore the basis for in-race ranking.
orcPerformanceCurveLeaderForBaselineRankingMetricDescription=ORC Performance Curve: Sophisticated handicapping scheme that awards time allowances based on a VPP/polar assuming pre-defined legs'' angles to the wind;\nthe greatest implied wind value is determined; all boats are ranked by mapping this greatest implied wind to their performance curves, determining their allowance for that implied wind\nand then computing the delta to their elapsed time. The baseline for corrected times is the boat with the least relative corrected time.
timeOnTimeAndDistanceRankingMetricDescription=Time-on-Time / Time-on-Distance: Final ranking by calculated time;\ntime is calculated by optionally applying a factor to the actual time (defaulting to 1.0)\nand subtracting an allowance in seconds per nautical mile,\napplied to the course length.\nIn-race ranks based on expected arrival at fastest boat''s current position\nassuming current leg''s average VMG/VMC.

orcPerformanceCurveLegTypeDescriptionWindwardLeewardRealLive=Windward/Leeward (up and down) is a conventional course around windward and leeward marks where the race course consists of 50% upwind and 50% downwind legs.\nDuring the race, upwind and downwind legs will automatically be modeled as respective "constructed course" legs for better predictions, whereas after the race the averaged values will apply for all legs.
