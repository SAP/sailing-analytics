			<li>The race list is now ordered by fleets. This means we display the same order of our backend system in the RCApp.

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Moved away from using a label to create a course and introduced a big button that
			eases the input of courses.</li>
			
			<li>Added a new countdown button for ESS and RRS26 start configurations. Using this
			button one can easily set the start time of a race to exactly the time the countdown starts.</li>
		</ul>
