	<div class="innerContent">
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2016</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Added responsive design. You can now use the app on every tablet as well as on <b>mobile phones</b>.</li>
			<li>We returned the group races switch to ESS races. It's located in the left panel bar (or top on phones).</li>
			<li>The behavior of ESS course designer is compact in two lists. The marks and rounding can be easily changed by tapping on it.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>Fixes for Android Lollipop were deployed. They solve font size and other display issues.
		    </li>
		    <li>The true wind direction provided during wind entry in the app is now interpreted to be a
		        direction based on magnetic north, not true north. This is common practice as wind readings
		        are typically produced on a start vessel based on a magnetic compass device.
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>Added support for dependent start times. Races can set their start time relative
		    	to another race's start time. Caveat: Currently, when aborting races on which other
		    	races depend, requires either aborting the dependent races before or setting an
		    	absolute start time on the dependent races.
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>Major overhaul of the entire race committee app. The app has a completely new user interface
		        with a light and a dark theme. The functionality generally remained unchanged.
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h5>
		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>The race list is now ordered by fleets. This means we display the same order of our backend system in the RCApp.
			Now the race officials can easily use the order which is displayed and do not have to care about the fleet color order.</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h5>
		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Moved away from using a label to create a course and introduced a big button that
			eases the input of courses.</li>
			
			<li>Added a new countdown button for ESS and RRS26 start configurations. Using this
			button one can easily set the start time of a race to exactly the time the countdown starts.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h5>
		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Server-based device configuration</li>

			<li>Device initialization with QR codes</li>

			<li>Automatic upgrades and downgrades to match server software version</li>

			<li>Multiple devices can work on the same race (e.g., start vessel, finishing vessel, shore control)</li>
