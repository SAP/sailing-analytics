            <li>The GPS fix sending was optimize to send all data in a bulk. Instead of sending
                every fix separately. This will reduce the battery consumption and minimize the
                used traffic overhead.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue, where the app stopped tracking, if the app was in background and
                killed by the system in case of low memory. Now the tracking will not stop, because
                the system can't stop the service.</li>
