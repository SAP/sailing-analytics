            <li>Improved tracking status and accuracy reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">October 2016</h5>
        <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>Improved tracking reliability and accuracy,
            especially when the app is in background by using a more reliable and controllable API:
            The app will now only use true GPS signals instead of accepting
            positions acquired through network triangulation.</li>
            <li>There now is a more detailed energy saving option,
            and the automatic overriding of user preferences has been removed.</li>
            <li>In some rare situations the app crashed, if you want to scan a QR-Code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2016</h5>

        <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>The GPS fix sending was optimize to send all data in a bulk. Instead of sending
                every fix separately. This will reduce the battery consumption and minimize the
                used traffic overhead.</li>
            <li>Fixed an issue, where the app stopped tracking, if the app was in background and
                killed by the system in case of low memory. Now the tracking will not stop, because
                the system can't stop the service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2016</h5>

        <ul class="bulletList">
            <li>It is possible to track buoys for multiple regattas. Scan all buoy QR-codes and
                start tracking for one buoy. It will track all buoys.</li>
        </ul>
