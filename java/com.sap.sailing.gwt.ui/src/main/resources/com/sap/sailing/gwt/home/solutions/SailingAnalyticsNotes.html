		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>The leaderboard offers a new column: "Start delay." It shows the number of seconds that passed
		        since the race start and the time the competitor passes the start mark / start line. As usual,
		        you can sort for this column. For line starts, this is a fairly direct measure of start quality
		        except for port starts which may have to be considered differently. For gate starts, you can use
		        this measure to find out about early and late starters and dig into possible correlations between
		        results and start time point.
		    </li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2015</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>The race viewer ("RaceBoard.html") now offers a new option in the map settings:
			"Show simulation overlay". Checking this feature will simulate the current leader's leg
			using different strategies and using the wind as it has been measured and estimated.
			This feature becomes particularly interesting when combined with the "Show wind streamlets overlay"
			feature that visualizes the spatial distribution of the wind field over the course.
		    </li>
		    <li>The race viewer is now more resilient against exceptional conditions such as the missing
		        of all wind information and the missing of a course with its waypoints. If no wind information
			is available at all (no wind direction indicator is then shown in the upper left corner of
			the map) then all ranking and distances will be based on a projection onto the course instead
			of onto the wind direction, even for upwind and downwind legs.
		    </li>
		</ul>
	
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">September 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>The search feature now also includes results from currently ongoing events that may not yet be
		        included in our archive. Search keywords are now properly used in constructing the query.
		    </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">August 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
		    <li>The 2D race viewer, also known as the "Race Board," now comes with a fresh, new design. The orange
		        checkbox toggle buttons that open or close views such as the leaderboard or the charts for wind
		        and competitor comparison, have been replaced by tabs with "&gt;&gt;" symbols. Clicking on those
		        will expand or collapse the respective view. The views can now be resized using the handles attached
		        to the dividers separating the views. They work much better on mobile and touch devices than the splitters
		        used previously did. The settings buttons that used to be integrated with the orange toggle
		        checkbox buttons have now been moved into the views that they control. For example, the map settings
		        button is now displayed on the map, below the zoom control on the right map border.
		    </li>
		    <li>The leaderboard now has an improved search and filter control. Above the table displaying the
		        competitors and their figures is a new field with a text input that you can use to filter for
		        competitors, by their sail number or their name. While filtered, use the checkboxes in front of
		        the table row to add the competitor to or remove it from the selection. Use the "X" button to the
		        right of the search input field to clear the search. To the left of the search input field is a
		        filter symbol that you can use to select and create advanced filtering rules, such as filtering
		        by rank or nationality. Left of the filter button is the leaderboard settings button.
		    </li>
			<li>The leaderboard has a new first column: a selection check box. We hope this makes it easier in
			    particular for users on mobile or other touch devices to select more than one competitor at a time.
			    The old-style multi-selection using the Control and Shift keys, as known well from typical desktop
			    file explorers, still work like they did before. Note that it is possible to sort for the checkbox
			    column, putting the selected competitors at the top of the leaderboard.
			</li>
			<li>When using the auto-zoom feature from the map settings, boats and wind streamlets will now
			    continue to move smoothly as long as the map only needs panning. Please also note that auto-zooming
			    to "tails" may slow down the display considerable, particularly when tracking at high frequency.
			</li>
	        <li>When viewing a single race, the leaderboard now by default does no longer show the regatta rank as
			    the first column (and not as the second one either, given that the first column now usually shows
			    the checkboxes used for selecting items). If you'd like to get the regatta rank column back, also when
			    looking at a single race, please choose it from the leaderboard settings dialog where you can find it
			    in the "Overall Details" section. It may still be a nice column to have when following the last race
			    in a regatta. If you're just interested in the relative regatta rank ordering you may as well sort by
			    the right-most total points column which (surprising to some but welcome by most) sorts by the regatta
			    rank and not by the plain points sum (taking into account medal race and gold/silver/... fleet participations).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>The advantage line now uses the wind at the position in the middle of the leg that the
			    competitor to which the line is attached is currently sailing in. Before, the "global" wind
			    average was used which is still displayed in the top left corner of the map. You can understand
			    the details by turning on the "Streamlet" wind visualization in the Map Settings.
			</li>
			<li>Faster wind streamlet loading: when you activate the streamlets for wind visualization, they now
			    display much faster.
			</li>
			<li>Faster boat position display: We found that what you're probably the most interested in when
			    you first open a race map or move the time slider to some very different point in time is the
			    position of the boats at that point in time; and you want to know it fast.
			    The tails which show how the boats got there are also interesting, but you won't blame us as much
			    if it takes a little bit to update them. So we've separated the placement of the boats from the
			    drawing of their tails. Now you may blame us for the tails temporarily not being attached to the
			    boats anymore ;-).
			</li>
		</ul>
	    
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">June 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>In the "Maps" settings in the RaceBoard page there is a new checkbox named
			    "Show wind streamlets overlay." If you select it and wait for about a minute,
			    a complete wind field will be calculated and visualized as an overlay on top
			    of the race course display. It reacts to you moving the time slider and shows
			    how the wind differs at different locations on the course. Stronger and faster-moving
			    streamlets mean stronger breeze.
			</li>
			<li>Wind is now calculated location-based. At locations closer to a sensor, that sensor
			    has a higher influence on the local wind field than sensors further away. The wind
			    estimations based on the courses sailed are assigned a location that corresponds with
			    the "center of gravity" of the field that was used for the estimation. For example,
			    if the fleet is approaching the windward mark and the wind sensor in on the committee
			    boat on the leeward side of the course, the course-based estimation influences the
			    assumed wind field more on the windward side whereas the sensor counts more for
			    the leeward side.
			</li>
			<li>Switched to the latest version of the Highcharts charting framework. This leads to improvements
			    especially on mobile devices. Charts can be zoomed using pinch gestures now.
			</li>
			<li>To support the use of the SAP Sailing Analytics also for live video streaming formats, we
			    introduced a new URL parameter <tt>viewShowMapControls</tt> for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt>
			    and the <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> pages. Setting this parameter to "false"
			    will suppress the zoom, pan and map type selection
			    controls on the map display. Example:
			    <a href="http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false">http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false</a>.
			    When used for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt> URL, this will apply
			    to all <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> pages (all races) reached from there. Of course, the map
			    can still be panned and zoomed using the usual mouse gestures. A left double click zooms
			    in, a right double click zooms out. Zoom can also be controlled using the mouse wheel.
			    And panning works by clicking on the map and dragging the mouse. Without the map type
			    control, switching to satellite view is not possible (keep this in mind when tracking
			    races in China, see below for Google's random coordinate transformations there).
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">May 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Fixed an issue with the wind speed charts. Charts that only had a single, unchanged
			    wind speed crashed the browser. The solution scales the right hand side Y-axis denoting
			    the wind speed such that it always starts at 0kts.
			</li> 
			<li>Analysis of tacks and jibes around mark passings has now been improved. Before,
			    a jibe followed by a tack that turns in the same direction (e.g., to port) so far
			    was always called a penalty maneuver. Now, if a mark passing separates such a tack
			    from such a jibe, no penalty is called anymore, and the two maneuvers are identified
			    correctly.
			</li>
			<li>Another note on maneuver analysis: we received questions regarding the maneuvers
			    involved in clearing an OCS. The SAP Sailing Analytics treat a clearing of
			    an OCS, going back behind the start line and crossing it again, as if the competitor
			    started again. In particular this means that all maneuvers prior to this new start
			    do not count for the metrics; neither does the distance sailed between the first (OCS)
			    start and the clear start.
			</li>
			<li>A hint regarding the "distance to start line" metrics: please keep in mind that currently this
			    measurement is calculated as the distance of the GPS tracker from the line. Unless the tracker
			    is mounted near the bow (or at the bow sprit, if any), the distance calculated this way will
			    be greater than what counts for crossing the line. Ordering, comparing and aggregating over this
			    figure still makes sense as long as you remember this detail.
			</li>
			<li>Introduced a new leaderboard entry "XTE +/-" featuring a signed cross-track error which shows
			    for a leg and also aggregated for an entire race on which side of the leg a competitor stayed on
			    average. Currently, the "side" is defined as viewing in the leg's direction, so "left" for a downwind
			    leg is the same side as "right" for the corresponding upwind leg.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">April 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>China races, such as in Qingdao, may have the map background displayed at slightly wrong locations.
			    This is due to an intentional random transformation that Google applies to GPS locations for
			    China. You can circumvent this issue by switching to satellite view where the map background is displayed
			    correctly. <img src="images/mapsatellite.png"/>
			</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that in some cases has caused the wind chart, the advantage line, the wind indicator on the map
			    and the leaderboard to use slightly different wind values. The problem was related to different averaging and
			    damping methods used for these values which has now been aligned.
			</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug that caused the time spent in a leg, race or regatta to always show the time at the end of the leg
			    if the leg has been started by the competitor at the time point queried, e.g., by the time slider. While this
			    did not have any serious effects in live mode, for replay races this left the leg time and race time constant
				at the total time spent so far up to the end of the last leg the competitor had started at that time.
		    </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Added a new setting for a leaderboard called "Show added scores". Using this feature one
			can display added scores for each leaderboard entry. An added score is the sum over all scores
			from the first column to the current column. One can describe it as an intermediate overall score.
			This feature can be used to know the score until a specific race while another race is live and
			constantly changes the overall score.</li>
			
			<li>Added tooltips for leaderboard settings.</li>
			
			<li>Fixed HighPointOverall scheme to also break a tie by looking at the ranks of the last regatta.</li>

			<li>Progress indicator when expanding a race in the RaceBoard view</li>

			<li>Leaderboard column "GPS Lag" shows how far a competitor's GPS signal lags behind the average
			    tracking quality. A background color bar classifies into good/ok/bad (green/yellow/red).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Fixed an issue with boat rotation on Safari browsers</li>

			<li>Maneuver analysis now counts tacks and jibes based on wind
			    at boat position and not based on leg type; subsequently,
			    penalty circle analysis is now based on a tack and a jibe
			    in close succession instead of a full circle.</li>

			<li>Regatta rank and overall rank in competitor chart of leaderboard panel
			    has been fixed; it did erroneously display the rank of the particular
			    race, not the regatta/overall rank after that race.</li>

			<li>Regatta overview now also displays all regatta leaderboards</li>

			<li>Boat colors match tail colors</li>
			
			<li>When selecting boats in leaderboard, de-selected boats' tails turn grey</li>

		</ul>


		<h5 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h5>

		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Boat movement animated smoothly</li>

			<li>Start and Finish line show line parameters (length, angle to wind,
		advantage) when mouse hovers over them</li>

			<li>Start line has a count-down indicator displayed next to it
		before the start. The count-down is also displayed underneath the time
		slider</li>

			<li>Competitor and Wind charts show pre-start data where possible</li>

			<li>Competitors can be assigned a fixed color which they will keep
		for all races in a regatta</li>

			<li>By default, videos are now shown in a moveable, resizable box embedded in
		the web page. For a two screen setup, the embedded box can be popped out to a
		dedicated browser window.</li>

			<li>Official score corrections for historic races are only applied after
		the respective competitor finished the race. Therefore, in-between race
		scores now correspond with tracking, regardless of final corrected score.</li>
		
		    <li>By using negative playback speed (e.g., -1), replays can be run backwards.</li>
