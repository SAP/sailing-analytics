<p>
Contains parser base classes, parser implementations and parser factory for
supported NMEA 0183 sentences. Notice that parsers, excluding the base class,
are private and accessed only through sentence factory and interfaces. Custom
parsers may be implemented by extending the base parser and registering it in
the factory.
