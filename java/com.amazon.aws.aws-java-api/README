This is an OSGi wrapper project around the parts of the AWS Java SDK libraries required by
this project. There is a Gradle configuration (build.gradle, settings.gradle). Change to this
project's directory (${workspace}/java/com.amazon.aws.aws-java-api) and run

	rm ./lib/*
	../../gradlew downloadLibs

This will download all JARs required for the components listed in build.gradle in the
dependencies section, such as

    implementation 'software.amazon.awssdk:s3'

Add more components by adding more lines, such as

    implementation 'software.amazon.awssdk:ec2'

and repeat the process as needed. Make sure to update build.properties to
reference the additional JAR files (which can alternatively be accomplished through the MANIFEST.MF
editor's "Runtime" tab).

To download source JARs which can then be attached, add lines such as the following to the dependencies section:

    implementation group: 'software.amazon.awssdk', name: 's3', classifier: 'sources'

This will fetch the source JAR corresponding to the s3 code JAR. To attach it, go to the project's
build path settings, expand the code JAR's tree node in the "Libraries" tab, select the "Source Attachment"
sub-node, click the "Edit" button and select the source JAR that got downloaded. Don't forget to add the
source JAR to the git repository.
