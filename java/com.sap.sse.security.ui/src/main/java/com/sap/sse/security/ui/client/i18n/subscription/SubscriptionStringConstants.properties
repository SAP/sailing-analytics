businessModelDescription=We decided to extend our free solution by a Subscription offering. \
    While you can still follow the basic racing action and see a live wind-based leaderboard for free, \
    we would like to ask for your contribution in case you appreciate the many advanced features that \
    the SAP Sailing Analytics offer. \
    For more than a decade, SAP has fully sponsored this solution and made it available to thousands \
    of sailing events worldwide. Now you have the opportunity to help in keeping the solution available \
    to the sailing community. All payments for any subscription you choose will directly go to development \
    partners who help with operations, support, maintenance and further development of the Sailing Analytics. \
    You can leave your suggestions at https://bugzilla.sapsailing.com and follow the development progress there. \
    We thank you for your understanding and continued support!
