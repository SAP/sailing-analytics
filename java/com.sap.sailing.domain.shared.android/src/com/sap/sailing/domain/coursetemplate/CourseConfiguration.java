/**
 * A course that does not necessarily consist of {@link Mark}s existing in a regatta but instead is defined by
 * {@link MarkConfiguration}s. This means changes to the model are easily possible without requiring to pollute the
 * {@link RegattaLog}. The effective Marks will then be created upon Course creation based on the
 * {@link MarkConfiguration}s. See, e.g.,
 * {@link CourseAndMarkConfigurationFactory#createCourseFromConfigurationAndDefineMarksAsNeeded}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This is the model represented in a course editor which deals with editing the waypoint sequence as well as changing
 * how marks are mapped to {@link MarkTemplate}s and how marks are generally configured in terms of their base
 * properties and tracking/positioning information. This configuration can reference a non-{@code null}
 * {@link CourseTemplate} (returned by {@link #getOptionalCourseTemplate()}). Being an "editor model" this means that
 * the actual {@link #getWaypoints() waypoint sequence} may be inconsistent with what the course template demands. When
 * requesting a course update, the waypoint sequence takes precedence over a course template. Likewise, the
 * {@link #getNumberOfLaps() number of laps} in a request to create a course may be inconsistent with the waypoint
 * sequence which then should be interpreted such that the request processor shall adjust the waypoint sequence such
 * that the number of laps requested is reflected in the waypoint sequence consistently.
 * <p>
 * 
 * When used in a request to create a course template, the {@link #getRepeatablePart()} will be used as the new course
 * template's {@link CourseTemplate#getRepeatablePart() repeatable part}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In particular, the base {@link #getWaypoints() waypoints sequence}, when returned by a request, has at least one
 * occurrence of a repeatable part, should the configuration specify a course template, be consistent with it, and
 * should the course template specify a repeatable part. As a response, this configuration will tell the
 * {@link #getNumberOfLaps()} found or created during the request.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The configuration for all marks are returned by {@link #getAllMarks()} because when pushing this to a Regatta the
 * marks for all these configurations have to be established.
 *
 * @param <P>
 *            the type used to {@link MarkConfiguration#getAnnotationInfo() annotate} the {@link MarkProperties} used in
 *            this course configuration. Different annotations are expected to be used for course configurations used in
 *            requests sent to a service and for responses produced by a service.
