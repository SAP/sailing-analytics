/**
 * <p>
 * A {@link RaceLogEvent} is an entry in a race's log (typically a {@link RaceLog}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Such an entry may influence the state of a race (scheduled, started, finished, ...), contain information about the
 * current displayed flags (AP, N, X, P, etc.) of a race or indicate some other change regarding the race. See
 * subclasses of {@link RaceLogEvent} for a full list of possibilities.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link RaceLogEvent} may be associated to a certain pass. For a race a new pass is initiated whenever a new start
 * time is proposed (e.g. after the race was aborted).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each {@link RaceLogEvent} carries two timestamps.
 * 
 * The timestamp received with {@link RaceLogEvent#getCreatedAt()} denotes the point in time the event was created.
 * 
 * The timestamp received with {@link RaceLogEvent#getTimePoint()} denotes the logical point in time the event has
 * occurred (sometimes called 'event time'). This timestamp might be different from {@link RaceLogEvent#getCreatedAt()}.
 * For example setting the start time of race to a point in time in the past, results in a {@link RaceLogEvent}
 * returning "now" on {@link RaceLogEvent#getCreatedAt()} and such a point in time that a complete startphase could have
 * occured on {@link RaceLogEvent#getTimePoint()}.
 * 
 * To ensure an ordering there should be no two {@link RaceLogEvent}s returning the same point in time on
 * {@link RaceLogEvent#getTimePoint()} <b>per pass</b>.
 * </p>
