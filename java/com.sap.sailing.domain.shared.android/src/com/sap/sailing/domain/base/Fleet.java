 * For each fleet in a {@link Series} there is one {@link RaceDefinition race} per "race column." Competitor to fleet
 * assignment may vary per race in case of the fleets being unordered in their {@link Series}, or may be fixed in case
 * the fleets are ordered in their {@link Series}, as usually the case in finals and medal series.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Fleets within the same {@link Series} as well as all fleets within the same {@link RaceColumn#getFleets() RaceColumn}
 * can be mutually compared to each other. Comparing fleets from different series produces undefined results. For a
 * {@link Series}, either all distinct fleets compare different (a series with ordered fleets such as Gold, Silver), or
 * all distinct fleets compare equal (e.g., for a qualifying series with fleets Yellow and Blue).
