/**
 * A {@link RaceGroup} is an abstract representation of a set of races managed in fleets and series.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This representation is needed to have an abstraction layer on top of regattas and (flexible) leaderboards. It is used
 * in communication with the Android applications.
 * <p>
 * 
 * To align with the semantics of the Android application a {@link RaceGroup} consists of race rows rather than race
 * columns. A {@link RaceRow} is a set of races for one {@link Fleet}. A specific "race" of a row is called
 * {@link RaceCell}. (Note that as described by bug 3011 this view is by now obsolete. The grouping by fleet is
 * no longer desired by users; instead, grouping is desired only by regatta / {@link RaceGroup}, whereas <em>ordering</em>
 * and <em>filtering</em> is based on series and fleet pertinence and {@link RaceState race state}, respectively.)
 * <p>
 * 
 * For example: if you have 2 fleets (blue and yellow) there will be 2 {@link RaceRow}s in your {@link RaceGroup}
 * series, each associated with {@link Fleet}. Both the rows of the blue and yellow fleet carries {@link RaceCell} named
 * "R1", "R2",...
