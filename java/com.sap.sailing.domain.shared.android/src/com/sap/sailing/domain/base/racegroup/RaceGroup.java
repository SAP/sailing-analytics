/**
 * A {@link RaceGroup} is an abstract representation of a set of races
 * managed in fleets and series.
 * 
 * This representation is needed to have an abstraction layer on top of
 * regattas and (flexible) leaderboards. It is used in communication with
 * the Android applications.
 * 
 * To align with the semantics of the Android application a {@link RaceGroup}
 * consists of race rows rather than race columns. A {@link RaceRow} is a set
 * of races for one {@link Fleet}. A specific "race" of a row is called
 * {@link RaceCell}.
 * 
 * For example: if you have 2 fleets (blue and yellow) there will be 2
 * {@link RaceRow}s in your {@link RaceGroup} series, each associated with
 * {@link Fleet}. Both the rows of the blue and yellow fleet carries {@link RaceCell}
 * named "R1", "R2",...
