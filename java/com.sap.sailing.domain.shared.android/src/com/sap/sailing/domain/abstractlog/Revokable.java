 * the event-iterators of the {@code RaceLog} ({@link RaceLog#getUnrevokedEvents()},
 * {@link RaceLog#getUnrevokedEventsDescending()}).
 * <p>
 * The event {@code r} can only successfully revoke {@code e}, if {@code r}'s priority is higher
 * (author prio, timepoint), and if {@code e} is of an event type that implements {@code Revokable}.
