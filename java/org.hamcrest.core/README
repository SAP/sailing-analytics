This project is our answer to the set of org.hamcrest problems with junit-4.13.2 and the split package
"org.hamcrest" to which two bundles, org.hamcrest.core-1.3.0 and org.hamcrest.library-1.3.0, both make
contributions in the pre-2.x Hamcrest version. This leads to problems with Tycho 2.7.x which seems to
be unable to handle split packages properly.

But using the bundle org.hamcrest-2.2.0 does not work out of the box for junit-4.13.2 because the junit
manifest requires the *bundle* org.hamcrest.core in version 1.3.0 or newer.

If we put both, org.hamcrest-2.2.0 and org.hamcrest.[core|library]-1.3.0, into the target platform
then junit will get the 1.3.0 version from org.hamcrest.core but everything else will obtain the Hamcrest
Matcher classes etc. from hamcrest-2.2.0, leading to incompatible classes.

This bundle requires the org.hamcrest-2.2.0 bundle and uses visibility:=reexport so that all packages
exported by org.hamcrest-2.2.0 are also exported by this bundle. This now satisfies junit-4.13.2's
Require-Bundle: org.hamcrest.core through this "shim" bundle.
