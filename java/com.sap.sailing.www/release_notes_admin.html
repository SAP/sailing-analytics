					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>The Event panel now links the event name to the event page in the new design. The old "RegattaOverview"
					        link is now shown in the panel below, shown when selecting the event in the table above, called
					        "Event Overview."
					    </li>
					</ul>

					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">December 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>We added user management. The /gwt/AdminConsole.html entry point for a fresh server set-up uses
						admin/admin as username/password. You can change the password in the "Advanced &gt; User Management"
						tab where also new users can be created. If you assign a use the role "admin" then the user will
						be able to use the administration console. Stay tuned for a more sophisticated set of roles and
						permissions to be added in the future.
					    </li>
					    <li>Reverse replication is now possible for selected events. When a replica instance receives a
					        modifying operation, such as a user logging in (creating a user session) or a wind fix being
						entered through the Race Committee App, this change will be sent from the replica to the master
						and from there be replicated to all other replicas attached.
					    </li>
					    <li>Starting a server with auto-replication enabled has been changed. The REPLICATE_ON_START environment
					        variable no longer is a Boolean value (True/False) but now has to list the replication services to be
						replicated from the master. The default environments for replicas at
						<a href="http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments">http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments</a>
						show how this works.
					    </li>
					    <li>The "Connectors" category has a new tab in the administration console, entitled "Regatta Structure Import".
					        If your regatta management system happens to be <a href="http://manage2sail.com">Manage2Sail</a> 
						you can enter an event ID and show the list of regattas, then set defaults for how they shall be
						created in the SAP Sailing Analytics. This allows you to import and create many regattas at once,
						saving the laborious effort of manually creating them. Obviously, this can come in handy at large
						events with regattas on many course areas in several different boat classes.
					    </li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>Replication has become much more robust and efficient. The initial load which used to be sent in a
					        single huge (although compressed) stream of data from the master to the replica(s) was hard to get
					        transmitted in the face of flaky and slow network connections. We've changed this: now the initial
					        load is transmitted as a sequence of messages using a message broker infrastructure. If a single
					        message doesn't arrive, it will be re-sent until it got through. The messages are buffered for several
					        minutes, so the initial load transmission can even survive and recover from severe network outages.<p>
					        
					        For the incremental replication process, we added compression, making the transmission more bandwidth-efficient
					        and therefore quicker and leaner. In addition, we've cleaned up the protocol a little, avoiding the
					        sending of redundant data, adding to the effects of compression. Replicating five live races with
					        approximately 40 to 50 competitors each, with four active wind measurement units each, requires approximately
					        30kB/s of network bandwidth between master and replica.
					    </li>
					    <li>Events now have lots of new attributes, particularly start/end date and multimedia content URLs</li>
					    
						<li>Regattas can now be edited to <em>not</em> perform start time inference based on start mark passings.
						    Usually, when no start time is set by the race committee app or by the tracking provider or manually
						    through the administration console, the start time is inferred from the mark passings for the start
						    line. However, this can lead to unpleasant effects when the race committee aborts or postpones a race
						    and doesn't set a new start time for some period of time. When during this period one or more boats
						    cross the start line, a new start time would be inferred implicitly, showing scores in the leaderboard
						    and starting to compute all sorts of metrics. To avoid this, uncheck the checkbox
						    "Use start time inference from start mark passings" in the regatta create / edit dialog.</li>
						    
						<li>When creating a regatta in the administration console, the regatta name is now taken from the create
						    dialog's "Name" field as-is and is no longer automatically extended by appending the boat class name
						    in parentheses to the base name. This is important to know if you so far have created several regattas
						    within the scope of the same event by simply providing the event name and the boat class name, relying
						    on the administration console to extend the regatta name by the boat class name because now with this
						    strategy your regattas would all be named the same. If you want to continue using some base name and
						    see the boat class name after the base name in parentheses you will now have to add that to the "Name"
						    field yourself, as in "Kieler Woche 2014 (470)". With this change, you can avoid having special
						    characters such as "/" in the regatta name which used to be a problem in particular for RESTful web services
						    that use the regatta name as a URL element. Boat classes such as "B/one" and "J/70" traditionally
						    had issues with this. Now, the regatta can simply be named "My Event (J70)" instead, and web service
						    access is hassle-free. The boat class can still be called "J/70" which can be useful if the result
						    management tool or the tracking partner spells it that way.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>XML export of leaderboards now also taking into account competitors that haven't sailed a race but got a score</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Series name can be edited</li>

						<li>Now one can add a new series to an existing regatta</li>

						<li>Introduced new series scheme where competitors are scored contigously over all fleets</li>
                    </ul>
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>New version of TracTrac connector that fixes issues with concurrent loading
					of many races</li>

						<li>Wind data can be imported from Expedition log files and from Igtimi WindBots</li>

						<li>Competitors can be assigned fixed colors</li>

						<li>Video files can be interactively linked to races</li>

						<li>Admin Console consistently sorts alpha-numeric items such that
					numbers embedded in text are sorted by their numeric values (Race 2
					precedes Race 11)</li>

						<li>AdminConsole has more consistent filter behavior as more columns are
					used for filtering; some sorting options were added</li>

						<li>Added a button to set the start time received of a tracked race. This time
						isn't persistent, so it'll be forgotten after a server restart</li>

						<li>Tracking a race with a wrong regatta is now forbidden</li>
