                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>A regatta now has an additional property: "Buoy zone radius in hull lengths." It
			    can be used to determine the radius of the zone around the marks in terms of
			    hull lengths. This sets the default for the race viewer (RaceBoard.html entry point)
			    based on the hull length as known from the boat class.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">September 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>When denoting a regatta for smartphone tracking, the "By Marks" course designer is
			    automatically selected if no active regatta configuration was set yet, or a warning
			    and question to the user is issued, strongly suggesting the use of the "By Marks" course
			    designer. Background: using the "By Name" course designer could accidentally delete a
			    valid course layout.
			</li>
			<li>Regattas now have an additional setting: "Control tracking from start and finish times."
			    With it, the start and finish times for a race as entered into the race log, e.g., through
			    the Race Management app, can be used by tracking connectors to control the tracking for
			    that race. So far, the TracTrac connector and the Smartphone connector have been
			    enabled. When a start time for a race
			    is received and the "Control..." flag is set, the tracking start time will be set to
			    five minutes before the race start time. Similarly, when the blue flag is lowered, signaling
			    that the race has finished, the tracking end time will be set to two minutes later.
			    This should make an operator's job easier when the race timing is maintained properly
			    through the race log, i.e., through the Race Management app.<p>
			    In turn, for the Smartphone tracking connector, start/end tracking times are recorded
			    automatically upon start and stop tracking actions only if the regatta is <em>not</em>
			    marked as "Control tracking from start and finish times." Background: with this it is
			    possible to start tracking for a number of races scheduled for a day and having the
			    Race Management app control the tracking times automatically.
			 </li>
			 <li>The "start of tracking" property on a tracked race now has to be set to a valid, non-empty value
			     in order for fixed to be accepted into the race. As before, an empty "end of tracking" value
			     means an open-ended interval, and fixes at or after the start of tracking time point will then
			     continue to be accepted.
			 </li>
			 <li>The device mappings dialog now shows the time point of the last fix received from each mapping
			     and has a convenient filter text box.
			 </li>
			 <li>Thread management has been improved. Fewer and more reasonably-designed thread pools
			     are now created, and thread priorities less than normal (for background operations) now
			     correctly map to operating system thread priorities, making foreground tasks more
			     responsive. The less excessive concurrency has furthermore healthy effects on memory
			     mamangement and garbage collection.
			 </li>
			 <li>Fixed a bug in the smart phone tracking course designer. When adding or removing marks
			     now, unsaved changes to the waypoints and control points tables are preserved.
			 </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">July 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>According to some change in a tracked races lifecycle, fix-tracking no longer depends
                            on tracking races via racelog event but is bound to denotation only. So fix-tracking
                            via smartphone apps or uploading tracking files can also be used in combination with
                            e.g. TracTrac.
                        </li>
                        <li>Because fix-tracking is now more flexible (see above), it is no longer restricted to
                            GPS-fixes. 
                        </li>
                        <li>It is now possible to track fixes from Bravo foiling sensor devices, currently used in
                            Extreme Sailing Series events only. This kind of data can be uploaded via a new dialog
                            within the AdminConsole (Connectors > Smartphone Tracking)  
                        </li>
			<li>When a competitor is suppressed in a leaderboard, now the other competitors ranking
			    worse will be "promoted" by one rank per better suppressed competitor. This way, live
			    ranks will be correct if, e.g., a "Flexible Leaderboard" is used for a separate scoring
			    scheme for only a subset of the competitor.
			</li>
			<li>When entering a fixed position for a mark in the "Smartphone Tracking" environment it is
			    now possible to enter a time stamp for the fix. This way it is also possible to adjust
			    a mark's position to a fixed lat/lng for some time point in the past.
			</li>
			<li>A series within a regatta can now define a maximum number of discards applied in that
			    series. When combined with leaderboard-wide discards, generally discards can be distributed
			    across the leaderboard as needed, but restricted by the maximum specified for each series.
			    Leave the maximum empty to not provide any maximum. Setting to 0 will cause no scores to
			    be discarded in that series.
			</li>
			<li>An event now has a "Base URL" which should be used to enable useful e-mail notifications with
			    links embedded in them that lead to the correct server. If a notification is to contain
			    a link to a dedicated event server, the event cannot be reached through www.sapsailing.com,
			    and so if this generic link is used as a default, users will end up not finding the page
			    linked to by the notification.
			</li>
			<li>The checkboxes "Track Wind" and "Correct by Declination" are now switched on by default
			    for smartphone-tracked races
			</li>
                    </ul>
			
                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">June 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Some REST APIs have slightly changed. The /api/v1/leaderboards/{name} resource now
			    has the "netPoints" and "totalPoints" stuff right. The "netPoints" always refer to
			    scores which may be reduced due to discarding rules. Total points always refer to
			    the points before applying any discarding rules. Those numeric values for which so far
			    accidentally String types with double-quoted values were used have been changed to
			    numeric types, represented in the JSON documents without double quotes.
			</li>
			<li>It is now possible to use overlapping leaderboard groups in an event, such that one
			    leaderboard can be part of more than one leaderboard group of the event. This comes in
			    handy if there are different schemes by which the regattas or leaderboards may be grouped
			    and is particularly useful for large events for filtering the regattas in the event
			    overview. Please note that in case a leaderboard is part of a leaderboard group with
			    an overall leaderboard ("series scoring"), the leaderboard group with the overall
			    leaderboard must be provided as the first of the overlapping leaderboard groups in
			    the scope of the event.
			</li>
			<li>Earlier releases have introduced an issue with leaderboard configuration and with binding
			    tracked races to their leaderboard slots. When a filter is set for the tracked races list,
			    changing the leaderboard selection or changing the race column selection such that the
			    tracked race for a selected race column is not visible due to the filter, the connection
			    between the race column and the tracked race is removed.<p>
			    In order to reduce chances for failure, now at least changing the leaderboard selection
			    will de-select any selected race column, making sure that nothing needs to be selected
			    in the potentially filtered list of tracked races.<p>
			    However, trouble remains: changing the tracked races filter while having a race column
			    with a tracked race connected selected in the table on the left will unlink the race
			    column's tracked race. As a workaround, you'll have to either de-select the race column
			    in the left table before changing the filter, e.g., by Ctrl-clicking the race column
			    selected. Or you remove any filter text for the tracked races list before you change
			    the selection in the race column table. This will make sure that the race connected
			    to the race column that you may select next will be available for automatic selection.
			 </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">May 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Smartphone tracking support has been improved. When starting to track a race that has no
			    start-of-tracking time set yet, the start-of-tracking time will be set to the time point
			    when tracking has been started. Similarly, when stopping tracking and no end-of-tracking
			    time is set for the race yet, the current time is set as the end-of-tracking time for
			    that race.
			</li>
			<li>Regatta structure import from Manage2Sail now takes the boat class name from the
			    regatta, not the division element, giving better results.
			</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">April 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>In the "Race Manager App" regatta configuration settings, a new preference
			    "Activate result entry" has been added. It can enable or diable result entry
			    during or after the finishing phase in the Race Manager app. With this, it is
			    possible to configure up-front whether a race officer is offered the possibility to manage
			    results directly from the Race Manager app. This should <em>not</em> be used if an
			    external, official regatta management system is being used to capture and manage
			    the official scores.
			</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>For smartphone tracking, added shortcut to start/stop tracking of
                            race to each individual race (play/stop button in action column).
                        </li>
			<li>When starting/stopping to track a race using smartphone tracking the
			    tracking start/stop time is set to "now" if no time has previously been set.
			</li> 
                        <li>With the <b>MANAGE_MARK_POSITIONS</b> permission, users of the smartphone tracking feature can now
                            conveniently manipulate course mark positions from the <em>RaceBoard.html</em> entry point. When having
                            the permission, a new button "Edit Mark Positions" will be shown. Marks can then be selected from a
                            table, new fixes can be added and existing fixes can be moved. Note that the "Delete" menu item is
                            currently still disabled. Delete may be supported in future versions, though.
                        </li>
                        <li>The sailors info link is now also available for single regatta events in addition to multi regatta events that used to have this feature.
                            If a sailors info link is configured for events that are part of a series,
                            this isn't shown on the event page because the link to the series uses the same space in the UI and has higher priority.
                        </li>
                        <li>It's possible to configure language specific sailors info website links for events.
                            There is a default value that can be overwritten on a per locale base.
                            No sailors info link is shown for UI languages if there is neither a default link nor one for the specific locale,
                            even if there is one for another locale configured.
                        </li>
                        <li>The mechanism to handle RegattaOverview settings has been changed to a more generic approach.
                            This leads to slightly changed URL parameter names so that old bookmarks could be broken in a way
                            so that the actual shown set of races is different using the new version because the old parameters aren't correctly recognized.
                            All automatically generated links to this page in Home and AdminConsole have been updated to use the new parameter names.
                        </li>

                    <ul class="bulletList">
		    	<li>Several improvements regarding the creation of race metadata (events, regatta, etc.) including:
			automatic creation of default series, dialog for creating a default leaderboard group
			</li>
                        <li>The RaceBoard URL Parameter "canReplayDuringLiveRaces" has been removed.
                            This parameter was used to allow users to trigger autoplay for live races on non-live points in time.
                            The permission "CAN_REPLAY_DURING_LIVE_RACES" and role "moderator" now grant this functionality to users.

                        <li>The "Manage Media" button in RegattaOverview is now bound to the Permission "MANAGE_MEDIA".
                            The Roles "eventmanager" and "mediaeditor" grant the "MANAGE_MEDIA" permission.
                        </li>
                        <li>The "Edit mark passings" button in RegattaOverview is now bound to the Permission "MANAGE_MARK_PASSINGS".

						created in the SAP Sailing Analytics. This allows you to import and create many regattas at once,
						saving the laborious effort of manually creating them. Obviously, this can come in handy at large
						events with regattas on many course areas in several different boat classes.

					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>Replication has become much more robust and efficient. The initial load which used to be sent in a
					        single huge (although compressed) stream of data from the master to the replica(s) was hard to get
					        transmitted in the face of flaky and slow network connections. We've changed this: now the initial
					        load is transmitted as a sequence of messages using a message broker infrastructure. If a single
					        message doesn't arrive, it will be re-sent until it got through. The messages are buffered for several
					        minutes, so the initial load transmission can even survive and recover from severe network outages.<p>
					        
					        For the incremental replication process, we added compression, making the transmission more bandwidth-efficient
					        and therefore quicker and leaner. In addition, we've cleaned up the protocol a little, avoiding the
					        sending of redundant data, adding to the effects of compression. Replicating five live races with
					        approximately 40 to 50 competitors each, with four active wind measurement units each, requires approximately
					        30kB/s of network bandwidth between master and replica.

					    <li>Events now have lots of new attributes, particularly start/end date and multimedia content URLs</li>
					    
						<li>Regattas can now be edited to <em>not</em> perform start time inference based on start mark passings.
						    Usually, when no start time is set by the race committee app or by the tracking provider or manually
						    through the administration console, the start time is inferred from the mark passings for the start
						    line. However, this can lead to unpleasant effects when the race committee aborts or postpones a race
						    and doesn't set a new start time for some period of time. When during this period one or more boats
						    cross the start line, a new start time would be inferred implicitly, showing scores in the leaderboard
						    and starting to compute all sorts of metrics. To avoid this, uncheck the checkbox
						    "Use start time inference from start mark passings" in the regatta create / edit dialog.</li>
						    
						<li>When creating a regatta in the administration console, the regatta name is now taken from the create
						    dialog's "Name" field as-is and is no longer automatically extended by appending the boat class name
						    in parentheses to the base name. This is important to know if you so far have created several regattas
						    within the scope of the same event by simply providing the event name and the boat class name, relying
						    on the administration console to extend the regatta name by the boat class name because now with this
						    strategy your regattas would all be named the same. If you want to continue using some base name and
						    see the boat class name after the base name in parentheses you will now have to add that to the "Name"
						    field yourself, as in "Kieler Woche 2014 (470)". With this change, you can avoid having special
						    characters such as "/" in the regatta name which used to be a problem in particular for RESTful web services
						    that use the regatta name as a URL element. Boat classes such as "B/one" and "J/70" traditionally
						    had issues with this. Now, the regatta can simply be named "My Event (J70)" instead, and web service
						    access is hassle-free. The boat class can still be called "J/70" which can be useful if the result
						    management tool or the tracking partner spells it that way.</li>
