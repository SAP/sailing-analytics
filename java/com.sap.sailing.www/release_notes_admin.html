                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Smartphone tracking support has been improved. When starting to track a race that has no
			    start-of-tracking time set yet, the start-of-tracking time will be set to the time point
			    when tracking has been started. Similarly, when stopping tracking and no end-of-tracking
			    time is set for the race yet, the current time is set as the end-of-tracking time for
			    that race.
			</li>
			<li>Regatta structure import from Manage2Sail now takes the boat class name from the
			    regatta, not the division element, giving better results.
			</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">April 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>In the "Race Manager App" regatta configuration settings, a new preference
			    "Activate result entry" has been added. It can enable or diable result entry
			    during or after the finishing phase in the Race Manager app. With this, it is
			    possible to configure up-front whether a race officer is offered the possibility to manage
			    results directly from the Race Manager app. This should <em>not</em> be used if an
			    external, official regatta management system is being used to capture and manage
			    the official scores.
			</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>For smartphone tracking, added shortcut to start/stop tracking of
                            race to each individual race (play/stop button in action column).
                        </li>
			<li>When starting/stopping to track a race using smartphone tracking the
			    tracking start/stop time is set to "now" if no time has previously been set.
			</li> 
                        <li>With the <b>MANAGE_MARK_POSITIONS</b> permission, users of the smartphone tracking feature can now
                            conveniently manipulate course mark positions from the <em>RaceBoard.html</em> entry point. When having
                            the permission, a new button "Edit Mark Positions" will be shown. Marks can then be selected from a
                            table, new fixes can be added and existing fixes can be moved. Note that the "Delete" menu item is
                            currently still disabled. Delete may be supported in future versions, though.
                        </li>
                        <li>The sailors info link is now also available for single regatta events in addition to multi regatta events that used to have this feature.
                            If a sailors info link is configured for events that are part of a series,
                            this isn't shown on the event page because the link to the series uses the same space in the UI and has higher priority.
                        </li>
                        <li>It's possible to configure language specific sailors info website links for events.
                            There is a default value that can be overwritten on a per locale base.
                            No sailors info link is shown for UI languages if there is neither a default link nor one for the specific locale,
                            even if there is one for another locale configured.
                        </li>
                        <li>The mechanism to handle RegattaOverview settings has been changed to a more generic approach.
                            This leads to slightly changed URL parameter names so that old bookmarks could be broken in a way
                            so that the actual shown set of races is different using the new version because the old parameters aren't correctly recognized.
                            All automatically generated links to this page in Home and AdminConsole have been updated to use the new parameter names.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2016</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
		    	<li>Several improvements regarding the creation of race metadata (events, regatta, etc.) including:
			automatic creation of default series, dialog for creating a default leaderboard group
			</li>
                        <li>The RaceBoard URL Parameter "canReplayDuringLiveRaces" has been removed.
                            This parameter was used to allow users to trigger autoplay for live races on non-live points in time.
                            The permission "CAN_REPLAY_DURING_LIVE_RACES" and role "moderator" now grant this functionality to users.
                        </li>
                        <li>The "Manage Media" button in RegattaOverview is now bound to the Permission "MANAGE_MEDIA".
                            The Roles "eventmanager" and "mediaeditor" grant the "MANAGE_MEDIA" permission.
                        </li>
                        <li>The "Edit mark passings" button in RegattaOverview is now bound to the Permission "MANAGE_MARK_PASSINGS".
                            The Role "eventmanager" grants the "MANAGE_MARK_PASSINGS" permission.
                        </li>
                        <li>The user management page now provides a "Refresh" button to reload the user list.
                        </li>
                        <li>The user management page now also lists sailing roles and permissions in the respective suggest boxes.
                        </li>
                        <li>The "Edit Points" module is now bound to the Permission "MANAGE_LEADERBOARD_RESULTS".
                            The Role "eventmanager" grants the "MANAGE_LEADERBOARD_RESULTS" permission.
                        </li>
                        <li>There is now a UI element in the header of "Edit Points", "Admin Console" and "Races Overview" pages
                            that indicates the authentication and makes it possible to sign in/sign out without leaving the page.
                            The pages "Edit Points" and "Admin Console" will show a message instead of the page content
                            if you aren't autenticated or don't have the required permissions.
                        </li>

                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>The "RaceLog Tracking" panel was renamed to the more intuitive "Smartphone Tracking".
                        </li>
                        <li>Competitor and course information can now be copied independently from one race to another within a Smartphone-tracked leaderboard.

		    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">November 2015</h2>
		    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Adding a competitor to a leaderboard or a regatta pre-sets the competitor's boat class
                            according to the leaderboard's / regatta's boat class.
                        </li>
                        <li>When done with creating a regatta, the user can have the corresponding regatta leaderboard
                        	created with a simple click instead of having to navigate to the "Leaderboards" tab.
                        </li>
                        <li>Trim leaderboard and leaderboard group names during creation, removing leading and trailing
                            blanks. These names can occur in URLs, and trailing blanks in particular may be trimmed,
                            causing the objects to not be found.

					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">September 2015</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>A new scoring scheme for elimination rounds has been added. It will first be used
					        at a major wind surfing event.
					    </li>
					    <li>The "Device Configuration" tab has been moved into a new top-level tab
					        "Race Committee App".
					    </li>
					    <li>Included magnetic declination data for 2016 already.
					    </li>
					    <li>Bug fix: in rare cases, adding several series to a regatta in one go swapped the order
					        of the series to be created. This has now been fixed.
					    </li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">August 2015</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>Race log tracking now allows administrators to set the start and end of tracking for a race.
					        Competitor and mark positions as well as wind data are filtered based on the start/end of tracking
					        intervals.
					    </li>
					    <li>Setting the boat class for a regatta and when creating a competitor has been unified and now
					        uses a suggest text box which makes suggestions based on all the boat classes known by the
					        application. In both cases can users now also enter a "free-form" boat class which is then
					        created by the server if not known yet. Note that for such boat classes no boat class icon
					        will be present when showing the regatta on the web page.
					    </li>
					    <li>Added boat classes Soling, Lago 26, Kielzugvogel, PWA (Professional Windsurfers Association)
					    </li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">June 2015</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>An event an now have a "Sailors' Info" URL configured. If provided, there will be a button
					        displayed on the event's web page that navigates to this link. It can be used, e.g., to link
					        to official documents such as the notice of race, sailing instructions, weather information
					        or similar.
					    </li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">April 2015</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>Competitors can now have a flag image assigned. This image should ideally be
					        sized 18x11px. If such an image is assigned, it overrules the nationality flag.
					        Use this feature to provide club flags for sailing league events.
					    </li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2015</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>The Event panel now links the event name to the event page in the new design. The old "RegattaOverview"
					        link is now shown in the panel below, shown when selecting the event in the table above, called
					        "Event Overview."
					    </li>
					</ul>

					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">December 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>We added user management. The /gwt/AdminConsole.html entry point for a fresh server set-up uses
						admin/admin as username/password. You can change the password in the "Advanced &gt; User Management"
						tab where also new users can be created. If you assign a use the role "admin" then the user will
						be able to use the administration console. Stay tuned for a more sophisticated set of roles and
						permissions to be added in the future.
					    </li>
					    <li>Reverse replication is now possible for selected events. When a replica instance receives a
					        modifying operation, such as a user logging in (creating a user session) or a wind fix being
						entered through the Race Committee App, this change will be sent from the replica to the master
						and from there be replicated to all other replicas attached.
					    </li>
					    <li>Starting a server with auto-replication enabled has been changed. The REPLICATE_ON_START environment
					        variable no longer is a Boolean value (True/False) but now has to list the replication services to be
						replicated from the master. The default environments for replicas at
						<a href="http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments">http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments</a>
						show how this works.
					    </li>
					    <li>The "Connectors" category has a new tab in the administration console, entitled "Regatta Structure Import".
					        If your regatta management system happens to be <a href="http://manage2sail.com">Manage2Sail</a> 
						you can enter an event ID and show the list of regattas, then set defaults for how they shall be
						created in the SAP Sailing Analytics. This allows you to import and create many regattas at once,
						saving the laborious effort of manually creating them. Obviously, this can come in handy at large
						events with regattas on many course areas in several different boat classes.
					    </li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>Replication has become much more robust and efficient. The initial load which used to be sent in a
					        single huge (although compressed) stream of data from the master to the replica(s) was hard to get
					        transmitted in the face of flaky and slow network connections. We've changed this: now the initial
					        load is transmitted as a sequence of messages using a message broker infrastructure. If a single
					        message doesn't arrive, it will be re-sent until it got through. The messages are buffered for several
					        minutes, so the initial load transmission can even survive and recover from severe network outages.<p>
					        
					        For the incremental replication process, we added compression, making the transmission more bandwidth-efficient
					        and therefore quicker and leaner. In addition, we've cleaned up the protocol a little, avoiding the
					        sending of redundant data, adding to the effects of compression. Replicating five live races with
					        approximately 40 to 50 competitors each, with four active wind measurement units each, requires approximately
					        30kB/s of network bandwidth between master and replica.
					    </li>
					    <li>Events now have lots of new attributes, particularly start/end date and multimedia content URLs</li>
					    
						<li>Regattas can now be edited to <em>not</em> perform start time inference based on start mark passings.
						    Usually, when no start time is set by the race committee app or by the tracking provider or manually
						    through the administration console, the start time is inferred from the mark passings for the start
						    line. However, this can lead to unpleasant effects when the race committee aborts or postpones a race
						    and doesn't set a new start time for some period of time. When during this period one or more boats
						    cross the start line, a new start time would be inferred implicitly, showing scores in the leaderboard
						    and starting to compute all sorts of metrics. To avoid this, uncheck the checkbox
						    "Use start time inference from start mark passings" in the regatta create / edit dialog.</li>
						    
						<li>When creating a regatta in the administration console, the regatta name is now taken from the create
						    dialog's "Name" field as-is and is no longer automatically extended by appending the boat class name
						    in parentheses to the base name. This is important to know if you so far have created several regattas
						    within the scope of the same event by simply providing the event name and the boat class name, relying
						    on the administration console to extend the regatta name by the boat class name because now with this
						    strategy your regattas would all be named the same. If you want to continue using some base name and
						    see the boat class name after the base name in parentheses you will now have to add that to the "Name"
						    field yourself, as in "Kieler Woche 2014 (470)". With this change, you can avoid having special
						    characters such as "/" in the regatta name which used to be a problem in particular for RESTful web services
						    that use the regatta name as a URL element. Boat classes such as "B/one" and "J/70" traditionally
						    had issues with this. Now, the regatta can simply be named "My Event (J70)" instead, and web service
						    access is hassle-free. The boat class can still be called "J/70" which can be useful if the result
						    management tool or the tracking partner spells it that way.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>XML export of leaderboards now also taking into account competitors that haven't sailed a race but got a score</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Series name can be edited</li>

						<li>Now one can add a new series to an existing regatta</li>

						<li>Introduced new series scheme where competitors are scored contigously over all fleets</li>
                    </ul>
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>New version of TracTrac connector that fixes issues with concurrent loading
					of many races</li>

						<li>Wind data can be imported from Expedition log files and from Igtimi WindBots</li>

						<li>Competitors can be assigned fixed colors</li>

						<li>Video files can be interactively linked to races</li>

						<li>Admin Console consistently sorts alpha-numeric items such that
					numbers embedded in text are sorted by their numeric values (Race 2
					precedes Race 11)</li>

						<li>AdminConsole has more consistent filter behavior as more columns are
					used for filtering; some sorting options were added</li>

						<li>Added a button to set the start time received of a tracked race. This time
						isn't persistent, so it'll be forgotten after a server restart</li>

						<li>Tracking a race with a wrong regatta is now forbidden</li>
