					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>Events now have lots of new attributes, particularly start/end date and multimedia content URLs</li>
					    
						<li>Regattas can now be edited to <em>not</em> perform start time inference based on start mark passings.
						    Usually, when no start time is set by the race committee app or by the tracking provider or manually
						    through the administration console, the start time is inferred from the mark passings for the start
						    line. However, this can lead to unpleasant effects when the race committee aborts or postpones a race
						    and doesn't set a new start time for some period of time. When during this period one or more boats
						    cross the start line, a new start time would be inferred implicitly, showing scores in the leaderboard
						    and starting to compute all sorts of metrics. To avoid this, uncheck the checkbox
						    "Use start time inference from start mark passings" in the regatta create / edit dialog.</li>
						    
						<li>When creating a regatta in the administration console, the regatta name is now taken from the create
						    dialog's "Name" field as-is and is no longer automatically extended by appending the boat class name
						    in parentheses to the base name. This is important to know if you so far have created several regattas
						    within the scope of the same event by simply providing the event name and the boat class name, relying
						    on the administration console to extend the regatta name by the boat class name because now with this
						    strategy your regattas would all be named the same. If you want to continue using some base name and
						    see the boat class name after the base name in parentheses you will now have to add that to the "Name"
						    field yourself, as in "Kieler Woche 2014 (470)".</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>XML export of leaderboards now also taking into account competitors that haven't sailed a race but got a score</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Series name can be edited</li>

						<li>Now one can add a new series to an existing regatta</li>

						<li>Introduced new series scheme where competitors are scored contigously over all fleets</li>
                    </ul>
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>New version of TracTrac connector that fixes issues with concurrent loading
					of many races</li>

						<li>Wind data can be imported from Expedition log files and from Igtimi WindBots</li>

						<li>Competitors can be assigned fixed colors</li>

						<li>Video files can be interactively linked to races</li>

						<li>Admin Console consistently sorts alpha-numeric items such that
					numbers embedded in text are sorted by their numeric values (Race 2
					precedes Race 11)</li>

						<li>AdminConsole has more consistent filter behavior as more columns are
					used for filtering; some sorting options were added</li>

						<li>Added a button to set the start time received of a tracked race. This time
						isn't persistent, so it'll be forgotten after a server restart</li>

						<li>Tracking a race with a wrong regatta is now forbidden</li>
