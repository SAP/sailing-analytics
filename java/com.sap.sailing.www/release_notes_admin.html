                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Ranks (finishing orders) entered by the Race Manager app user are no longer
			    considered for handicap regattas. Only an explicit score will be accepted,
			    or a finishing time can be provided which will then let the handicap ranking
			    metric infer the correct rank from that.
			</li>
	                <li>Maneuver markers that appear when clicking on a boat while the RaceBoard is paused
	                    were sometimes hard to click because they disappeared behind the boat's tail.
	                    This behavior is now fixed.
	                </li>
	                <li>Fixed an issue with result import URL removal in case the URL erroneously contains
	                    more than one space character.
	                </li>
	                <li>Fixed a problem with competitor import: competitors imported now correctly obtain
	                    the current session's user as their owner, and the current session's user's
	                    default creation group as their owning group.
	                </li>
	                <li>Fixed issues with Manage2Sail regatta structure import: Imports of regattas with
	                    no "ClassName" property, such as handicap / Yardstick regattas, will now create
	                    regattas with "?" as boat class name to avoid other problems; furthermore,
	                    due to a permission check that was too restrictive, regattas to import could not
	                    be seen unless the user had "super-admin" power.
	                </li>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">April 2019</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>Filtering the leaderboard groups during a Master Data Import now also
			    handles quoted strings correctly. With this, e.g., searching for a
			    leaderboard group containing "Apr 2" in its name is doable.
			</li>
			<li>In AdminConsole.html all tables and lists are now filtered to only show domain objects readable by the current user.
                This means additional objects may exist on the server and can cause errors due to name conflicts.<br>
                To allow users to grant others permissions for their stuff, it is possible to manage permissions for users whose username is known without having a read permission for that user.
                In addition, users may be added to groups by only knowing their username.
			</li>
			<li>The permission system was extended to allow groups to directly grant roles to their users.
                In addition such a role can also be granted to all users (including anonymous ones).
                Roles associated to groups only grant permissions to domain objects owned by that group.<br>
                Example: By associating the <tt>sailing_viewer</tt> role to a group with "for all users" enabled, all objects owned by that group are publicly readable.
			</li>
			<li>When loading or tracking wind from Igtimi, only accounts readable by the current user will be used.
                On dedicated event servers, such an account should be owned by the server group.
                This ensures, that all server admins will consistently use this account while tracking races.
			</li>
			<li>Replication is now also secured by several actions of the SERVER security type.
                Due to permission checks on the master side, it is now necessary to provide credentials of a user that exists
                on the master server that is used when a replica contacts the master.
                This user at least needs to have the permission <tt>SERVER:REPLICATE:&amp;server-name&amp;</tt> granted on the master.<br>
                Server start scripts as well as the replication documentation have been updated to include details about configuring credentials for auto replication.
                Newly created servers should automatically contain adjusted versions of the relevant scripts.
                The configuration of existing servers needs to get updated accordingly. The environment variables considered by the
                start script are: <tt>REPLICATE_MASTER_USERNAME</tt> and <tt>REPLICATE_MASTER_PASSWORD</tt>, or alternatively,
                <tt>REPLICATE_MASTER_BEARER_TOKEN</tt> which can be obtained from the master server, e.g., by
                <tt>curl -d "username=myuser&amp;password=mysecretpassword" "https://master-server.sapsailing.com/security/api/restsecurity/access_token" | jq .access_token</tt>.
                These map to the system properties <tt>replicate.master.username</tt>, <tt>replicate.master.password</tt>, and
                <tt>replicate.master.bearer_token</tt>, respectively.
			</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2019</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>By caching serialized results of leaderboard requests the server now requires
			    significantly less CPU power during live situations. Instead of computing the
			    serialized representation of a leaderboard again and again, the serialized version
			    is maintained in the cache as long as the original object from which the serialized
			    version was produced is referenced. This way, the cache cleans itself. It can be
			    observed through JMX, e.g., using JConsole, by looking at the JMX bean
			    <tt>com.sap.sse:type=GWTRPCSerializedResultCache_*</tt>.
			</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2019</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
			<li>The pairing list construction supports a new parameter that can be used
			    to balance fairness of boat assignment with the reduction of boat changes
			    between flights. It can be set between 0 (focus on fair boat assignments;
			    use this, e.g., if there are noticeable differences between the boats used
			    to ensure a fair distribution) and the number of flights, e.g., 14 or 15 for
			    a typical league set-up (focus on reducing the number of boat changes while
			    sacrificing a bit of boat assignment fairness).
			</li>
			<li>The built-in mark passing calculator that is primarily used for smartphone
			    tracking has been improved. In particular, it now recognizes trackers left behind,
			    e.g., on a committee boat, and avoids performance issues incurred by these scenarios
			    by filtering possible mark passing candidates using a bounding box-based approach:
			    if a tracker hardly moves over some time, only the most promising candidates from
			    that time interval are considered. This avoids compute time and memory issues
			    seen in the past.
			</li>
			<li>When during a server re-start with the <tt>-Drestore.tracked.races=true</tt> parameter
			    restoring a race fails with an exception, that race is now removed from the restore list,
			    a corresponding <tt>SEVERE</tt> log entry is written, and the server will no longer try
			    to restore that race upon future restarts. This way, races that have been removed at
			    their source will not keep causing permanent restore trouble, and manual database
			    intervention is no longer necessary.
			</li>
			<li>A new status REST endpoint has been added: <tt>/gwt/status</tt>. It combines the status
			    checks of <tt>/sailingserver/api/v1/status</tt> and <tt>/replication/replication?action=STATUS</tt>,
			    and because it is offered by the same module hosting the web UI of the server, its availability
			    indicates that the corresponding module has started and has registered with the web server
			    successfully. It reports a 200 HTTP response if itself and the status reports it syndicates
			    report availability, a non-2XX status otherwise.
			</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">January 2019</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Allow entering a priority for courses managed in the AdminConsole.
                            The new default priority now is 1. It used to be 0 which caused problems
                            because the Race Manager app's highest (logically) priority is 1 which
                            never took priority over the AdminConsole-provided prio-0 events.</li>
                        <li>User sessions are now stored durably in the database so that they can be
                            restored in case of a server re-start. Users therefore will no longer need
                            to sign in again only because a server was re-started.</li>
                        <li>New availability checks have been implemented. Two new REST endpoints are provided:
                            <ul>
                              <li>/sailingserver/api/v1/status reports the availability of the "Sailing" application</li>
                              <li>/replication/replication?action=STATUS reports the availability of the replication module,
                                  providing details about each replication-capable component and queue lengths</li>
                              <li>the "status" script in the server's working directory, next to the "start" and "stop"
                                  script, now provides output based on the status checks above, plus a check for a 2XX
                                  response code for /index.html. The exit code for the "status" script is now 1 in case
                                  of an error / lack of availability, and 0 if all checks passed and server looks
                                  available.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
			<li>Upgraded the MongoDB driver to version 3.6.4. This allows you to specify the new
			    retryWrites parameter, e.g., as in "mongodb://mongo0.internal.sapsailing.com/mydb?replicaSet=live&retryWrites=true".
			    This will improve your system's behavior if you run with a MongoDB replica set and have to
			    assume that at some point the PRIMARY MongoDB system may fail, with the remaining systems
			    in the replica set voting for a new PRIMARY. Without retryWrites your system will bluntly
			    fail, but with retryWrites, write operations will be re-tried once, with a timeout usually
			    enough for the remaining replicas to agree on a new PRIMARY.
			</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Added progress indicator to device mappings panel for smartphone tracking.</li>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">September 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Added automatic resizing when adding images to an event using the ImageDialog. 
                        It shows a check box if resizing is necessary, if you check it, the service will resize the image for you.</li>
                        <li>Now showing an error when trying to upload an image or video to an event and no working FileStorageService is registered.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">August 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>The mark passing editor now uses a full date/time format for the mark passing time points.</li>
                        <li>The TracTrac connector panel no longer shows a password visibly but uses a password text field.</li>
                        <li>The SwissTiming connector can now handle an "Update URL" together with username/password access
                            credentials which are used, if present, to send feedback requests about start times, race status
                            and course changes to that URL.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">July 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>When adding a YouTube video for tracked races ("Manage Media" in <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> or "Tracked Races > Audio & Video" in <tt>AdminConsole.html</tt>) the respective video metadata is now read using YouTube API v3.
                            This functionality used to work some years ago using API v2 but was broken since this API version was discontinued some time ago.
                            Due to limitations of the new API we can't read the start timepoint of videos by now. You still need to provide this value manually.</li>
                        <li>In the "Tracked races" tab, within the eponymous section of the AdminConsole, the "Set start
                            time received" dialog can be used to remove the currently set start time received, by simply
                            leaving the value empty and confirming the dialog.</li>
                        <li>Up to 15 discards can now be configured for series and leaderboards. This enables, e.g., "Wednesday Night" scenarios
                            where over the season, say, 20 races are run but due to changing participation only, say, the five best ones shall be scored.</li>
                        <li>There is a new scoring scheme available to be selected upon regatta creation.
                            The scoring scheme is named "Low Point System, First with two wins in medals is winner" and introduces the following specifics compared to the standard low point scheme:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Medal series does not feature doubling of points in the medal series by default.</li>
                                <li>A competitor having two wins in the medal series is treated as overall winner.
                                    If there is a carry forward column in the medal series, having one point there also counts as a win which means the best competitor in the qualification needs a win less than any other finalist to be the overall winner.</li>
                                <li>If the medal series isn't started yet or no competitor has collected two wins, scoring by points is used.
                                    This also applies if the regatta is aborted (e.g. due to weather conditions) before any competitor could win two races in the medal series.</li>
                                <li>If two competitors have the same amount of points in the medal series the tie breaking criteria is the carry forward column of the medal series.
                                    If there is no carry forward column in the medal series, the last medal race is used as tie breaking criteria.
                                    For any non-medal series, the standard low point rules apply.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A TracAPI upgrade from version 3.10.1 to 3.11.0 unifies the handling of course updates and solves an issue
                            observed with updating mark passing instructions.</li>
                        <li>Bug fix for mark position editor, now providing consistent behavior during adding of new mark fixes</li>
                        <li>Data Mining now more aggressively terminates running queries if needed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">June 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Added the available WindFinder Spot Collections. The desired ones can be selected from the WindFinder Tab in the Event Dialog.</li>
                        <li>Added the ability to change the url of multiple Mediatracks with a common prefix at once.
                            This is useful e.g. for video migration scenarios when movin videaos from one server to another.
                            This can be done from the adminconsole->tracked races->audio & videos tab</li>
                        <li>In raceboard when you edit a video you do not need to explicitly press "Preview" before saving anymore.
                            Saving now implicitly applies the changes.</li>
                        <li>The URLs of our GWT services are extended to include a leaderboard name if a call is context sensitive to a specific leaderboard.
                            This does not affect the functionality of any service but allows us to setup load balancing with leaderboard specific routing.
                            The leaderboard names put into the URL are cleaned: Any character that isn't a latin upper/lowercase letter or digit is replaced with an underscore character.
                            Currently, the following leaderboard specific URLs are used:
                            <ul>
                                <li>/gwt/service/sailing/leaderboard/[CLEANED-LEADERBOARD-NAME]</li>
                                <li>/gwt/service/dispatch/leaderboard/[CLEANED-LEADERBOARD-NAME]</li>
                            </ul>
                            Be aware that request without leaderboard suffix may be sent from pages that do not show leaderboard specific contents.
                            Due to this it is required to define a fallback rule for any unqualified request.
                            </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">May 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Added the ability to add multiple mp4 videos as mediatracks at once via the new multi video dialog, located at trackedraces -> Audio & Video.
                            This features requires a webserver with index listing enabled. Additionally the dialog offers the ability to add the new mediatracks 
                            directly to all races overlapping the starttime and duration of the mediatrack.</li>
                        <li>On the "Edit mark positions" panel within RaceBoard, now a "Clear selection" button appears
                            when selecting a mark from the table, which provides an easier and more obvious way to
                            deselect all marks, what is needed in order to see the full course with all marks again.</li>
                        <li>The <tt>AutoPlay.html</tt> configuration "Sixty Inch" was improved for the usage with events that aren't part of an event series.
                            While no race is live or scheduled, only the overall leaderboard used to be shown.
                            In addition to this, also the regatta leaderboard is shown in an alternating order.
                            For non series events there is no overall leaderboard which means, that only the regatta leaderboard is shown.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>The import of additional expedition data was extended to read many additional measures.
                            These can be visualized in the leaderboard as well as the competitor charts in <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt>.
                            In addition, the leaderboard has been extended to provide bravo and expedition related measures consistently on race and leg level.
                            The respective settings dialogs were changed as well to only show specific options, if bravo or expedition tracks are available.
                            Any previously imported expedition tracks may be dropped and reimported to gain access to the newly introduced measures.</li>
                        <li>The settings dialog of the competitor charts in <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> now provides the measures in alphabetical order (based on the current locale).
                            Expedition specific measures - if available - are shown at the end of the list.</li>
                        <li>The all in one expedition import has been extended to be able to import new competitor tracks or new races to an existing regatta.
                            Previously it was only possible to import a new event structure.</li>
                        <li>The Expedition log file import now prefers "GPS Time" for time stamping over "Utc" and over other date / time formats, making it
                            more consistent with the Expedition live connector which uses column 146 for time stamping which is GPS Time.</li>
                        <li>Two dimensional metrics can now be displayed by using a scatter plot presenter within the data mining tool.
                            Select a metric that returns a pair of numbers and choose "Average" or "Identity" as an aggregator.</li>
                        <li>Replication was made more robust for fixes that are delivered and applied asynchronously. If a race was removed
                            while still in tracking mode, fix-related operations may have been queued already on the replica when the
                            tracked race is removed. The pending GPS fix operations then would have clogged the executor threads until
                            the entire replica comes to a halt. With the change, race-related asynchronous operations will simply be
                            dropped when the race to which they pertain is not found on the replica.</li>
                        <li>When editing mark positions, all fixes are now displayed, including potential outliers.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Boats are now separate entities. See the "Tracked Races / Boats" tab in the admin console.
                            When creating a regatta, you now need to specify whether in that regatta the competitors
                            may sail on changing boats ("Can boats of competitors change per race").
                            If boats can change, boat assignments need to be specified per
                            race. For the TracTrac connector this may happen as in the past, using the corresponding
                            metadata attributes (boatName, either one of boatId or boatUuid, and boatColor) on the
                            competitors in the race. For smartphone tracking, boats can be specified in the
                            "Connectors / Smartphone Tracking" tab by using the boat icon in the actions column of
                            the leaderboards table ("Boat Registrations"). This defines the boats from which you can
                            then select in the scope of each race of the regatta. When adding competitors to such
                            a race then you now have to assign boats from the boats list to each competitor before
                            you can confirm the competitor-to-race assignments.
                        </li>
                        <li>User, role and permission management has been extended. A new "tenant" concept
                            is now available. Users can belong to zero or more tenants and can have a default
                            tenant for a login session. Zero or more users can belong to a tenant. Objects have
                            a tenant owner and a user owner, similar to group and user ownerships of files in a
                            file system.<p>
                            By default, each user receives a default tenant that is named like the user, with "-tenant"
                            appended. This applies during user migration to this new version, as well as during
                            creation of new users. While a "default tenant" only specifies the tenant that objects
                            created by the user will have as their tenant owner, by default the user also "belongs"
                            to its default tenant (is part of that tenant's user group).<p>
                            Roles are now defined explicitly, in the "Roles" tab in the "Advanced" category.
                            A new server that is not sharing the security service with any other server will
                            start out with a few default role definitions, such as "admin" and "user". Roles imply permissions,
                            and the permissions they imply can be modeled in the "Roles" tab.<p>
                            Roles can be assigned to users in the UI-refurbished "User Management" tab in the
                            "Advanced" category. There is now a table with users that currently exist in the
                            system, with a pager and a filter box. Editing a user shows an edit dialog for that
                            user where roles and permissions can be added. Adding permissions works as usual.
                            However, when adding roles, qualifications for a tenant owner and a user owner
                            can be added using the following format for the role's name: &lt;rolename&gt;[:[&lt;tenantname&gt;][:[&lt;username&gt;]]].
                        </li>
                        <li>In addition to track competitors and marks using smartphone-tracking it is now possible to track boats.
                            This is e.g. useful for several national leagues where competitors are assigned dynamically to boats for each race.
                            In this case the competitors were used to bring a smartphone with them to the assigned boat.
                            With the recent changes regarding boat and competitor mapping per race, Smartphone-tracking is now enabled to dynamically track boat-mapped devices to the correct competitors in the context of a race.
                            There are two ways to add boats to be tracked to a regatta:
                            <ul>
                                <li>After adding a denotation to the racelog(s), add competitors to at least one race and ensure that the boats to be tracked are mapped to those</li>
                                <li>Register boats directly to the regatta</li>
                            </ul>
                            For available boats, you can now add mappings and generate a QR code in the corresponding dialog.
                            In addition, it is possible to upload tracking files and map them to boats.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2018</h2>
                    <ul class="bulletList">
                        <li>Further improvements of maneuver detection algorithm were introduced. Mark Passing is no longer regarded as a separate maneuver type. Instead, it is regarded as a supplementary information which gets appended to a maneuver instance. Therefore, a new filtering dimension was added for maneuver data mining, which is boolean and is named as "Mark Passing".</li>
                        <li>Added leaderboard group name as a dimension to a leaderboard's context</li>
                        <li>Added True Wind Angle as a data mining statistic on GPS fixes</li>
                        <li>Time points for wind data related to individual fixes now uses the fixes' specific time points, not the wind at the middle of the leg</li>
                        <li>Finally, the data mining UI sorts wind strengths given in Beaufort according to their strengths, not their names</li>
                            For example, a simple role name such as "admin" will give an unqualified role to the user.
                            To constrain the "admin" role to objects whose tenant owner is the tenant "abc", use
                            "admin:abc" for the role. To assign the role "admin" so that it applies only to objects
                            owner by user "u938" use "admin::u938".<p>
                            Tenants can be managed in the "Tenant Management" tab in the "Advanced" category. Here,
                            tenants can be created, removed and the set of users belonging to each tenant can be
                            edited.<p>
                            During migration of an existing server to this new version, a new default tenant will be
                            created using the server's name. All existing objects will by default have this new default
                            tenant as their tenant owner, and no user owner. All existing role assignments will be migrated
                            such that all roles will have as tenant qualification the new default tenant. This way,
                            users will maintain the rights they were assigned through roles only for those objects
                            belonging to the server's new default tenant (by default all objects on that server).
                            Only when new objects are created with a different tenant then the role's permissions
                            won't apply because the roles were by default constrained to the server's default tenant.
                            This will allow us to consolidate, merge and join the security services of various servers
                            at a later point in time, ensuring that users will not obtain permissions for objects they
                            are not eligible for.

                        <li>In the raceboard the floating video box was improved, leading to a more solid resizing and moving behavior.</li>

                            This will make a new Button appear near to the settings button of the chart.
                            When you click this button you are being asked for a name of the new race.
                            A new race column is created in the same series the current race is associated to.
                            A new tracked race is then associated to the new column for the fleet of the current race.
                            This new race is being filled with the data from the current race for the selected time range.

                        <li>Authentication for Igtimi accounts is now possible with an OAuth process.
                            Instead of having to enter the username/password combination into the
                            administration console, a popup window will show an IFrame with Igtimi's
                            authentication form. Redirection goes to www.sapsailing.com, together with
                            a "state" URL parameter providing the base URL of the original server instance
                            requesting authentication. www.sapsailing.com will then redirect to that server,
                            removing the "state" parameter from the request and leaving only the "code"

                            request with a response code 302 (temporary redirect), but our TracTrac connector did
                            not handle this due to redirects that change protocols are not followed by default in
                            Java. This has now been changed, and although it is of course better to use the correct
                            protocol (HTTPS) right away, redirects will now be handled correctly, too.

                            scheme will apply as a default score for an RDG this average. As usual, as soon as an explicit
                            score is provided for the race, the default calculation will no longer be applied.

                        <li>The logic of the "Control tracking from start and finish times" check box now behaves slightly
                            differently. As before, a default start of tracking time is derived from the race start time
                            (currently five minutes before race start). Likewise, a default end of tracking time is derived
                            from the race finish time (the time when the blue flag was lowered, or more technically,
                            when a FINISHED race state was set in the race log) which is currently two minutes after
                            the race has finished. However, previously, when deviating start of tracking or end of tracking times
                            were set through other channels, such as received from TracTrac or set explicitly through
                            the administration console, new events would have been written to the race log, fixing the
                            start of tracking / end of tracking times according to the derivation rules.<p>
                            This logic has caused undesired effects and has therefore been removed. For example, when
                            an end of tracking time has been set explicitly through the administration console then
                            it may have been overwritten by a new end-of-tracking-time event appended to the race log
                            when the race is loaded again. Similarly, when a new start time was provided, an explicitly
                            set start of tracking time would have been canceled. With the new behavior, explicit settings
                            of start/end of tracking will remain untouched.<p>
                            For "Smartphone Tracking" the check box therefore now mainly controls whether or not a start/end
                            of tracking time is written to the race log when the user starts/stops tracking for the first time
                            through the administration console: when the tracking times are to be controlled by the race's
                            start and finish times, simply starting / stopping to track a race with the smartphone connector won't
                            set the start / end of tracking times.<p>
                            For the TracTrac connector, when the check box is set, as before messages will go out to TracTrac
                            when the race start / finish times have changed. The feedback from TracTrac will adjust the
                            tracking times as received by the connector, but no race log entries for the tracking times
                            will be created anymore.</li>
                        <li>A new type of leaderboard has been introduced: a regatta leaderboard with competitor elimination.
                            Such a leaderboard creates a view onto a regular regatta leaderboard and allows the user to
                            eliminate a subset of the competitors from its display. The scores of all remaining competitors
                            are taken from the original regatta leaderboard without modification, including all
                            corrections, penalties and the discarding rule, including the live ranks. This means,
                            in particular, that the ranks shown for a race in such a leaderboard are not contiguous in
                            case there are eliminated competitors. The score sum for each competitor is computed as usual.
                            For the regatta rank, a contiguous count is applied. This way it is possible to create
                            a new ranking for only a subset of the competitors; a practice common for championships
                            that want to publish a separate youth leaderboard, e.g., for all competitors under a
                            certain age.</li>

			     configuration file used during server startup and influenced by the server environments

			     for each replica.<p>
			     The master will restrict broadcasting its operations to those replicables for which
			     at least one replica has subscribed. While the initial load is requested individually
			     for each replica and can therefore be tailored to the replicas requested, the operation
			     broadcast channel is not specific to any replica. It therefore contains the operations
			     of all replicables for which at least one replica has subscribed. Replicas receiving
			     operations for replicables for which they did not subscribe will simply drop those
			     operations (note, however, that the replica will still have to read the operations from the
			     channel before dropping; this way, registering a replica may have bandwidth effects for
			     other replicas). Similarly, "backward replication" from a replica to a master will only
			     take place for those replicables for which the replica has requested replication from (and
			     therefore also "to") the master.<p>
			     With this it is now possible to replicate only the Security Service, using ID
			     <tt>com.sap.sse.security.impl.SecurityServiceImpl</tt>, running all other replicables
			     in "master mode." This will let the instance share user, permission, role and session management
			     details with the instance from which the Security Service is being replicated while
			     having its own master objects for all other replicables, such as the sailing application
			     (RacingEventService),  mail service or the polar data service. Note that with this feature
			     the server replicating another instance's Security Service will grant the roles and permissions
			     to subjects authenticated against that replicated Security Service. For example, if a user
			     has been granted the <tt>admin</tt> role by that service then the user has that role also
			     in all other server instances replicating that Security Service. Therefore, use this feature
			     with extreme caution. Keep in mind that in the near future we will extend the permissions and

			     and the server will start out with an empty set of tracked races.<p>
			     Note that the wind tracking properties, as set when initially tracking the race, are also restored
			     to their last state. If a live race has last been tracked with live wind tracking, with wind directions
			     being corrected by the local magnetic declination, then upon server restore the same live tracking will
			     be started again, including live wind tracking with the same declination correction settings.<p>
			     When the "Stop Tracking" feature is used, implicitly tracking wind will be stopped in case live wind
			     tracking had previously been requested for that race. This change is also considered during the restore
			     process where such a race will no longer receive live wind tracking upon restoring it.<p>
			     When a tracked race is removed from the server then it will not be restored anymore upon the next
			     server restart with the restore option enabled. When an entire regatta with a number of tracked
			     races linked into it is removed then the tracked races are removed as well and will not be
			     restored upon server re-start.<p>
			     The restore progress can be monitored using the JConsole or any other JMX monitoring tool. In the
			     <tt>com.sap.sailing</tt> category you will find the <tt>RacingEventService</tt> object. Among its
			     attributes there are now the two new ones: <tt>NumberOfTrackedRacesToRestore</tt> and

			     needs to already support this feature and the importing and exporting server
			     should be at roughly the same version to ensure binary compatibility for the

			<li>A regatta now has an additional property: "Buoy zone radius in hull lengths." It

			<li>When producing the QR code for the Race Management App's device configurations,

			<li>When denoting a regatta for smartphone tracking, the "By Marks" course designer is
			    automatically selected if no active regatta configuration was set yet, or a warning
			    and question to the user is issued, strongly suggesting the use of the "By Marks" course
			    designer. Background: using the "By Name" course designer could accidentally delete a
			    valid course layout.
			</li>
			<li>Regattas now have an additional setting: "Control tracking from start and finish times."
			    With it, the start and finish times for a race as entered into the race log, e.g., through
			    the Race Management app, can be used by tracking connectors to control the tracking for
			    that race. So far, the TracTrac connector and the Smartphone connector have been
			    enabled. When a start time for a race
			    is received and the "Control..." flag is set, the tracking start time will be set to
			    five minutes before the race start time. Similarly, when the blue flag is lowered, signaling
			    that the race has finished, the tracking end time will be set to two minutes later.
			    This should make an operator's job easier when the race timing is maintained properly
			    through the race log, i.e., through the Race Management app.<p>
			    In turn, for the Smartphone tracking connector, start/end tracking times are recorded
			    automatically upon start and stop tracking actions only if the regatta is <em>not</em>
			    marked as "Control tracking from start and finish times." Background: with this it is
			    possible to start tracking for a number of races scheduled for a day and having the
			    Race Management app control the tracking times automatically.
			 </li>
			 <li>The "start of tracking" property on a tracked race now has to be set to a valid, non-empty value
			     in order for fixed to be accepted into the race. As before, an empty "end of tracking" value
			     means an open-ended interval, and fixes at or after the start of tracking time point will then
			     continue to be accepted.
			 </li>
			 <li>The device mappings dialog now shows the time point of the last fix received from each mapping
			     and has a convenient filter text box.
			 </li>
			 <li>Thread management has been improved. Fewer and more reasonably-designed thread pools
			     are now created, and thread priorities less than normal (for background operations) now
			     correctly map to operating system thread priorities, making foreground tasks more
			     responsive. The less excessive concurrency has furthermore healthy effects on memory
			     mamangement and garbage collection.
			 </li>
			 <li>Fixed a bug in the smart phone tracking course designer. When adding or removing marks
			     now, unsaved changes to the waypoints and control points tables are preserved.

                        <li>According to some change in a tracked races lifecycle, fix-tracking no longer depends
                            on tracking races via racelog event but is bound to denotation only. So fix-tracking
                            via smartphone apps or uploading tracking files can also be used in combination with
                            e.g. TracTrac.
                        </li>
                        <li>Because fix-tracking is now more flexible (see above), it is no longer restricted to
                            GPS-fixes. 
                        </li>
                        <li>It is now possible to track fixes from Bravo foiling sensor devices, currently used in
                            Extreme Sailing Series events only. This kind of data can be uploaded via a new dialog
                            within the AdminConsole (Connectors > Smartphone Tracking)  
                        </li>
			<li>When a competitor is suppressed in a leaderboard, now the other competitors ranking
			    worse will be "promoted" by one rank per better suppressed competitor. This way, live
			    ranks will be correct if, e.g., a "Flexible Leaderboard" is used for a separate scoring
			    scheme for only a subset of the competitor.
			</li>
			<li>When entering a fixed position for a mark in the "Smartphone Tracking" environment it is
			    now possible to enter a time stamp for the fix. This way it is also possible to adjust
			    a mark's position to a fixed lat/lng for some time point in the past.
			</li>
			<li>A series within a regatta can now define a maximum number of discards applied in that
			    series. When combined with leaderboard-wide discards, generally discards can be distributed
			    across the leaderboard as needed, but restricted by the maximum specified for each series.
			    Leave the maximum empty to not provide any maximum. Setting to 0 will cause no scores to
			    be discarded in that series.
			</li>
			<li>An event now has a "Base URL" which should be used to enable useful e-mail notifications with
			    links embedded in them that lead to the correct server. If a notification is to contain
			    a link to a dedicated event server, the event cannot be reached through www.sapsailing.com,
			    and so if this generic link is used as a default, users will end up not finding the page
			    linked to by the notification.
			</li>
			<li>The checkboxes "Track Wind" and "Correct by Declination" are now switched on by default
			    for smartphone-tracked races

			<li>Some REST APIs have slightly changed. The /api/v1/leaderboards/{name} resource now
			    has the "netPoints" and "totalPoints" stuff right. The "netPoints" always refer to
			    scores which may be reduced due to discarding rules. Total points always refer to
			    the points before applying any discarding rules. Those numeric values for which so far
			    accidentally String types with double-quoted values were used have been changed to
			    numeric types, represented in the JSON documents without double quotes.
			</li>
			<li>It is now possible to use overlapping leaderboard groups in an event, such that one
			    leaderboard can be part of more than one leaderboard group of the event. This comes in
			    handy if there are different schemes by which the regattas or leaderboards may be grouped
			    and is particularly useful for large events for filtering the regattas in the event
			    overview. Please note that in case a leaderboard is part of a leaderboard group with
			    an overall leaderboard ("series scoring"), the leaderboard group with the overall
			    leaderboard must be provided as the first of the overlapping leaderboard groups in
			    the scope of the event.
			</li>
			<li>Earlier releases have introduced an issue with leaderboard configuration and with binding
			    tracked races to their leaderboard slots. When a filter is set for the tracked races list,
			    changing the leaderboard selection or changing the race column selection such that the
			    tracked race for a selected race column is not visible due to the filter, the connection
			    between the race column and the tracked race is removed.<p>
			    In order to reduce chances for failure, now at least changing the leaderboard selection
			    will de-select any selected race column, making sure that nothing needs to be selected
			    in the potentially filtered list of tracked races.<p>
			    However, trouble remains: changing the tracked races filter while having a race column
			    with a tracked race connected selected in the table on the left will unlink the race
			    column's tracked race. As a workaround, you'll have to either de-select the race column
			    in the left table before changing the filter, e.g., by Ctrl-clicking the race column
			    selected. Or you remove any filter text for the tracked races list before you change
			    the selection in the race column table. This will make sure that the race connected
			    to the race column that you may select next will be available for automatic selection.

					    <li>The Event panel now links the event name to the event page in the new design. The old "RegattaOverview"
					        link is now shown in the panel below, shown when selecting the event in the table above, called
					        "Event Overview."

					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">December 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>We added user management. The /gwt/AdminConsole.html entry point for a fresh server set-up uses
						admin/admin as username/password. You can change the password in the "Advanced &gt; User Management"
						tab where also new users can be created. If you assign a use the role "admin" then the user will
						be able to use the administration console. Stay tuned for a more sophisticated set of roles and
						permissions to be added in the future.
					    </li>
					    <li>Reverse replication is now possible for selected events. When a replica instance receives a
					        modifying operation, such as a user logging in (creating a user session) or a wind fix being
						entered through the Race Committee App, this change will be sent from the replica to the master
						and from there be replicated to all other replicas attached.
					    </li>
					    <li>Starting a server with auto-replication enabled has been changed. The REPLICATE_ON_START environment
					        variable no longer is a Boolean value (True/False) but now has to list the replication services to be
						replicated from the master. The default environments for replicas at
						<a href="http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments">http://releases.sapsailing.com/environments</a>
						show how this works.
					    </li>
					    <li>The "Connectors" category has a new tab in the administration console, entitled "Regatta Structure Import".
					        If your regatta management system happens to be <a href="http://manage2sail.com">Manage2Sail</a> 
						you can enter an event ID and show the list of regattas, then set defaults for how they shall be
						created in the SAP Sailing Analytics. This allows you to import and create many regattas at once,
						saving the laborious effort of manually creating them. Obviously, this can come in handy at large
						events with regattas on many course areas in several different boat classes.

					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h2>
					<ul class="bulletList">
					    <li>Replication has become much more robust and efficient. The initial load which used to be sent in a
					        single huge (although compressed) stream of data from the master to the replica(s) was hard to get
					        transmitted in the face of flaky and slow network connections. We've changed this: now the initial
					        load is transmitted as a sequence of messages using a message broker infrastructure. If a single
					        message doesn't arrive, it will be re-sent until it got through. The messages are buffered for several
					        minutes, so the initial load transmission can even survive and recover from severe network outages.<p>
					        
					        For the incremental replication process, we added compression, making the transmission more bandwidth-efficient
					        and therefore quicker and leaner. In addition, we've cleaned up the protocol a little, avoiding the
					        sending of redundant data, adding to the effects of compression. Replicating five live races with
					        approximately 40 to 50 competitors each, with four active wind measurement units each, requires approximately
					        30kB/s of network bandwidth between master and replica.
					    </li>
					    <li>Events now have lots of new attributes, particularly start/end date and multimedia content URLs</li>
					    
						<li>Regattas can now be edited to <em>not</em> perform start time inference based on start mark passings.
						    Usually, when no start time is set by the race committee app or by the tracking provider or manually
						    through the administration console, the start time is inferred from the mark passings for the start
						    line. However, this can lead to unpleasant effects when the race committee aborts or postpones a race
						    and doesn't set a new start time for some period of time. When during this period one or more boats
						    cross the start line, a new start time would be inferred implicitly, showing scores in the leaderboard
						    and starting to compute all sorts of metrics. To avoid this, uncheck the checkbox
						    "Use start time inference from start mark passings" in the regatta create / edit dialog.</li>
						    
						<li>When creating a regatta in the administration console, the regatta name is now taken from the create
						    dialog's "Name" field as-is and is no longer automatically extended by appending the boat class name
						    in parentheses to the base name. This is important to know if you so far have created several regattas
						    within the scope of the same event by simply providing the event name and the boat class name, relying
						    on the administration console to extend the regatta name by the boat class name because now with this
						    strategy your regattas would all be named the same. If you want to continue using some base name and
						    see the boat class name after the base name in parentheses you will now have to add that to the "Name"
						    field yourself, as in "Kieler Woche 2014 (470)". With this change, you can avoid having special
						    characters such as "/" in the regatta name which used to be a problem in particular for RESTful web services
						    that use the regatta name as a URL element. Boat classes such as "B/one" and "J/70" traditionally
						    had issues with this. Now, the regatta can simply be named "My Event (J70)" instead, and web service
						    access is hassle-free. The boat class can still be called "J/70" which can be useful if the result
						    management tool or the tracking partner spells it that way.</li>
