					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">May 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Introduced a new leaderboard entry "XTE +/-" featuring a signed cross-track error which shows
						    for a leg and also aggregated for an entire race on which side of the leg a competitor stayed on
						    average. Currently, the "side" is defined as viewing in the leg's direction, but we're considering
						    adjusting this for downwind legs such that "right" and "left" are mirrored to match things as
						    usually viewed from the start line.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">April 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>China races, such as in Qingdao, may have the map background displayed at slightly wrong locations.
						    This is due to an intentional random transformation that Google applies to GPS locations for
						    China. You can circumvent this issue by switching to satellite view where the map background is displayed
						    correctly. <img src="images/mapsatellite.png"/>
						</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug that in some cases has caused the wind chart, the advantage line, the wind indicator on the map
						    and the leaderboard to use slightly different wind values. The problem was related to different averaging and
						    damping methods used for these values which has now been aligned.
						</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug that caused the time spent in a leg, race or regatta to always show the time at the end of the leg
						    if the leg has been started by the competitor at the time point queried, e.g., by the time slider. While this
						    did not have any serious effects in live mode, for replay races this left the leg time and race time constant
							at the total time spent so far up to the end of the last leg the competitor had started at that time.
					    </li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Added a new setting for a leaderboard called "Show added scores". Using this feature one
						can display added scores for each leaderboard entry. An added score is the sum over all scores
						from the first column to the current column. One can describe it as an intermediate overall score.
						This feature can be used to know the score until a specific race while another race is live and
						constantly changes the overall score.</li>
						
						<li>Added tooltips for leaderboard settings.</li>
						
						<li>Fixed HighPointOverall scheme to also break a tie by looking at the ranks of the last regatta.</li>

						<li>Progress indicator when expanding a race in the RaceBoard view</li>

						<li>Leaderboard column "GPS Lag" shows how far a competitor's GPS signal lags behind the average
						    tracking quality. A background color bar classifies into good/ok/bad (green/yellow/red).</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Fixed an issue with boat rotation on Safari browsers</li>

						<li>Maneuver analysis now counts tacks and jibes based on wind
						    at boat position and not based on leg type; subsequently,
						    penalty circle analysis is now based on a tack and a jibe
						    in close succession instead of a full circle.</li>

						<li>Regatta rank and overall rank in competitor chart of leaderboard panel
						    has been fixed; it did erroneously display the rank of the particular
						    race, not the regatta/overall rank after that race.</li>

						<li>Regatta overview now also displays all regatta leaderboards</li>

						<li>Boat colors match tail colors</li>
						
						<li>When selecting boats in leaderboard, de-selected boats' tails turn grey</li>

					</ul>


					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Boat movement animated smoothly</li>

						<li>Start and Finish line show line parameters (length, angle to wind,
					advantage) when mouse hovers over them</li>

						<li>Start line has a count-down indicator displayed next to it
					before the start. The count-down is also displayed underneath the time
					slider</li>

						<li>Competitor and Wind charts show pre-start data where possible</li>

						<li>Competitors can be assigned a fixed color which they will keep
					for all races in a regatta</li>

						<li>By default, videos are now shown in a moveable, resizable box embedded in
					the web page. For a two screen setup, the embedded box can be popped out to a
					dedicated browser window.</li>

						<li>Official score corrections for historic races are only applied after
					the respective competitor finished the race. Therefore, in-between race
					scores now correspond with tracking, regardless of final corrected score.</li>
					
					    <li>By using negative playback speed (e.g., -1), replays can be run backwards.</li>
