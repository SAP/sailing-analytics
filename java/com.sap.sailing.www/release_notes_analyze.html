					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>The leaderboard has a new first column: a selection check box. We hope this makes it easier in
						    particular for users on mobile or other touch devices to select more than one competitor at a time.
						    The old-style multi-selection using the Control and Shift keys, as known well from typical desktop
						    file explorers, still work like they did before. Note that it is possible to sort for the checkbox
						    column, putting the selected competitors at the top of the leaderboard.
						</li>
					</ul>

   					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">July 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>The advantage line now uses the wind at the position in the middle of the leg that the
						    competitor to which the line is attached is currently sailing in. Before, the "global" wind
						    average was used which is still displayed in the top left corner of the map. You can understand
						    the details by turning on the "Streamlet" wind visualization in the Map Settings.
						</li>
						<li>Faster wind streamlet loading: when you activate the streamlets for wind visualization, they now
						    display much faster.
						</li>
						<li>Faster boat position display: We found that what you're probably the most interested in when
						    you first open a race map or move the time slider to some very different point in time is the
						    position of the boats at that point in time; and you want to know it fast.
						    The tails which show how the boats got there are also interesting, but you won't blame us as much
						    if it takes a little bit to update them. So we've separated the placement of the boats from the
						    drawing of their tails. Now you may blame us for the tails temporarily not being attached to the
						    boats anymore ;-).
						</li>
					</ul>
				    
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">June 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>In the "Maps" settings in the RaceBoard page there is a new checkbox named
						    "Show wind streamlets overlay." If you select it and wait for about a minute,
						    a complete wind field will be calculated and visualized as an overlay on top
						    of the race course display. It reacts to you moving the time slider and shows
						    how the wind differs at different locations on the course. Stronger and faster-moving
						    streamlets mean stronger breeze.
						</li>
						<li>Wind is now calculated location-based. At locations closer to a sensor, that sensor
						    has a higher influence on the local wind field than sensors further away. The wind
						    estimations based on the courses sailed are assigned a location that corresponds with
						    the "center of gravity" of the field that was used for the estimation. For example,
						    if the fleet is approaching the windward mark and the wind sensor in on the committee
						    boat on the leeward side of the course, the course-based estimation influences the
						    assumed wind field more on the windward side whereas the sensor counts more for
						    the leeward side.
						</li>
						<li>Switched to the latest version of the Highcharts charting framework. This leads to improvements
						    especially on mobile devices. Charts can be zoomed using pinch gestures now.
						</li>
						<li>To support the use of the SAP Sailing Analytics also for live video streaming formats, we
						    introduced a new URL parameter <tt>viewShowMapControls</tt> for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt>
						    and the <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> pages. Setting this parameter to "false"
						    will suppress the zoom, pan and map type selection
						    controls on the map display. Example:
						    <a href="http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false">http://danishleague2014.sapsailing.com/gwt/Spectator.html?leaderboardGroupName=Danish%20League%202014&showRaceDetails=true&viewShowMapControls=false</a>.
						    When used for the <tt>Spectator.html</tt> URL, this will apply
						    to all <tt>RaceBoard.html</tt> pages (all races) reached from there. Of course, the map
						    can still be panned and zoomed using the usual mouse gestures. A left double click zooms
						    in, a right double click zooms out. Zoom can also be controlled using the mouse wheel.
						    And panning works by clicking on the map and dragging the mouse. Without the map type
						    control, switching to satellite view is not possible (keep this in mind when tracking
						    races in China, see below for Google's random coordinate transformations there).
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">May 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Fixed an issue with the wind speed charts. Charts that only had a single, unchanged
						    wind speed crashed the browser. The solution scales the right hand side Y-axis denoting
						    the wind speed such that it always starts at 0kts.
						</li> 
						<li>Analysis of tacks and jibes around mark passings has now been improved. Before,
						    a jibe followed by a tack that turns in the same direction (e.g., to port) so far
						    was always called a penalty maneuver. Now, if a mark passing separates such a tack
						    from such a jibe, no penalty is called anymore, and the two maneuvers are identified
						    correctly.
						</li>
						<li>Another note on maneuver analysis: we received questions regarding the maneuvers
						    involved in clearing an OCS. The SAP Sailing Analytics treat a clearing of
						    an OCS, going back behind the start line and crossing it again, as if the competitor
						    started again. In particular this means that all maneuvers prior to this new start
						    do not count for the metrics; neither does the distance sailed between the first (OCS)
						    start and the clear start.
						</li>
						<li>A hint regarding the "distance to start line" metrics: please keep in mind that currently this
						    measurement is calculated as the distance of the GPS tracker from the line. Unless the tracker
						    is mounted near the bow (or at the bow sprit, if any), the distance calculated this way will
						    be greater than what counts for crossing the line. Ordering, comparing and aggregating over this
						    figure still makes sense as long as you remember this detail.
						</li>
						<li>Introduced a new leaderboard entry "XTE +/-" featuring a signed cross-track error which shows
						    for a leg and also aggregated for an entire race on which side of the leg a competitor stayed on
						    average. Currently, the "side" is defined as viewing in the leg's direction, so "left" for a downwind
						    leg is the same side as "right" for the corresponding upwind leg.
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">April 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>China races, such as in Qingdao, may have the map background displayed at slightly wrong locations.
						    This is due to an intentional random transformation that Google applies to GPS locations for
						    China. You can circumvent this issue by switching to satellite view where the map background is displayed
						    correctly. <img src="images/mapsatellite.png"/>
						</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug that in some cases has caused the wind chart, the advantage line, the wind indicator on the map
						    and the leaderboard to use slightly different wind values. The problem was related to different averaging and
						    damping methods used for these values which has now been aligned.
						</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug that caused the time spent in a leg, race or regatta to always show the time at the end of the leg
						    if the leg has been started by the competitor at the time point queried, e.g., by the time slider. While this
						    did not have any serious effects in live mode, for replay races this left the leg time and race time constant
							at the total time spent so far up to the end of the last leg the competitor had started at that time.
					    </li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">March 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Added a new setting for a leaderboard called "Show added scores". Using this feature one
						can display added scores for each leaderboard entry. An added score is the sum over all scores
						from the first column to the current column. One can describe it as an intermediate overall score.
						This feature can be used to know the score until a specific race while another race is live and
						constantly changes the overall score.</li>
						
						<li>Added tooltips for leaderboard settings.</li>
						
						<li>Fixed HighPointOverall scheme to also break a tie by looking at the ranks of the last regatta.</li>

						<li>Progress indicator when expanding a race in the RaceBoard view</li>

						<li>Leaderboard column "GPS Lag" shows how far a competitor's GPS signal lags behind the average
						    tracking quality. A background color bar classifies into good/ok/bad (green/yellow/red).</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">February 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Fixed an issue with boat rotation on Safari browsers</li>

						<li>Maneuver analysis now counts tacks and jibes based on wind
						    at boat position and not based on leg type; subsequently,
						    penalty circle analysis is now based on a tack and a jibe
						    in close succession instead of a full circle.</li>

						<li>Regatta rank and overall rank in competitor chart of leaderboard panel
						    has been fixed; it did erroneously display the rank of the particular
						    race, not the regatta/overall rank after that race.</li>

						<li>Regatta overview now also displays all regatta leaderboards</li>

						<li>Boat colors match tail colors</li>
						
						<li>When selecting boats in leaderboard, de-selected boats' tails turn grey</li>

					</ul>


					<h2 class="articleSubheadline">January 2014</h2>

					<ul class="bulletList">
						<li>Boat movement animated smoothly</li>

						<li>Start and Finish line show line parameters (length, angle to wind,
					advantage) when mouse hovers over them</li>

						<li>Start line has a count-down indicator displayed next to it
					before the start. The count-down is also displayed underneath the time
					slider</li>

						<li>Competitor and Wind charts show pre-start data where possible</li>

						<li>Competitors can be assigned a fixed color which they will keep
					for all races in a regatta</li>

						<li>By default, videos are now shown in a moveable, resizable box embedded in
					the web page. For a two screen setup, the embedded box can be popped out to a
					dedicated browser window.</li>

						<li>Official score corrections for historic races are only applied after
					the respective competitor finished the race. Therefore, in-between race
					scores now correspond with tracking, regardless of final corrected score.</li>
					
					    <li>By using negative playback speed (e.g., -1), replays can be run backwards.</li>
