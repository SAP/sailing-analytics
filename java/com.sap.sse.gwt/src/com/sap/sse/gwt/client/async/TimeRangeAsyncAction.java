/**
 * An action that will asynchronously execute a remote procedure that is parameterized by time ranges keyed by a set of
 * {@code Key}s (e.g., a competitor, or a boat or similar) and that returns a {@code Result}, most likely again keyed by
 * those {@code Key}s somehow. The action specifies by its return value for the {@link #getTimeRanges()} method for
 * which time ranges it would like to know the results. When
 * {@link TimeRangeActionsExecutor#execute(TimeRangeAsyncAction, TimeRangeAsyncCallback) executed} by a
 * {@link TimeRangeActionsExecutor}, that executor can trim the request time ranges based on cached requests, avoiding
 * redundant requests for overlapping time ranges. After the executor has trimmed the requests the executor will call
 * this action's {@link #execute(Map<Key,TimeRange>, AsyncCallback)} method with the trimmed time ranges.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The benefit of using this approach over making a straight call to the remote procedure is that the
 * {@link TimeRangeActionsExecutor} understands, manages and optimizes the overlaps in concurrent requests.
 *
 * @param <Result>
 *            Type returned by remote procedure.
 * @param <Key>
 *            Type used to index
 * @see TimeRangeActionsExecutor
