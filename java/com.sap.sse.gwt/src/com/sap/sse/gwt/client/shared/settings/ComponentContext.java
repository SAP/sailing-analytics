/**
 * Manages all default/initial settings of a component/perspective and its subcomponents if there are any.
 * It supplies components with initial settings and determines whether the settings of components are storable or not.
 * The settings can be stored with different scopes. The scope determines the influence of the stored settings on the
 * initial settings of the same component which is used to present a context (e.g. event or race).
 * Currently, there are two basic scopes which can be used for settings storage:
 * <dl>
 *  <dt>Document Settings</dt>
 *  <dd>The settings are stored only for the current context (e.g. a race presented in a RaceBoard). This settings are not considered in any other context. See {@link #storeSettingsForContext(Component, Settings, OnSettingsStoredCallback)}</dd>
 *  
 *  <dt>User Settings</dt>
 *  <dd>The settings are stored for a component/perspective context-independently and may effect a different context presented by the same perspective/component, e.g. a different race in a RaceBoard. See {@link #makeSettingsDefault(Component, Settings, OnSettingsStoredCallback)}</dd>
 * </dl>
 * A {@link SettingsStorageManager} is used as a persistence layer for settings.
 * When initial settings are loaded, {@link SettingsBuildingPipeline} is used to construct the settings object based on the data from the underlying settings store.
 * An example of such a settings construction might look as follows:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Get "System Default" settings by means of component lifecycles (see {@link ComponentLifecycle#createDefaultSettings()})</li>
 *  <li>Override the settings by values which are stored explicitly in the "User Settings"</li>
 *  <li>Override the settings by values which are stored explicitly in the "Document Settings"</li>
 *  <li>Override the settings by values which are set over URL</li>
 * </ol>
 * The whole settings construction pipeline, as well as {@link SettingsStorageManager} are customizable. For more information and possibilities see the existing implementations.
