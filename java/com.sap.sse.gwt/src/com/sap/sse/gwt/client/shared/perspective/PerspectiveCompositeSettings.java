/**
 * A composite settings class for a perspective aggregating the {@link #getPerspectiveOwnSettings() settings of the
 * perspective itself} as well as the settings of all contained components. The perspective-specific settings are
 * <em>not</em> part of the general composite settings' {@link #getSettingsPerComponentId()} result (although a
 * {@link Perspective} is a {@link Component}) to make it clear that the perspective to which these settings belong is
 * not nested in itself. Note that any of the component of the component/settings pairs returned by
 * {@link #getSettingsPerComponentId()} may again be a perspective.
