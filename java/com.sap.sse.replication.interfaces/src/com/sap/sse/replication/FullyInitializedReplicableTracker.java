/**
 * While a regular OSGi {@link ServiceTracker} would {@link ServiceTracker#waitForService(long) wait} for the service's
 * appearance in the OSGi registry and then return it, this specialization is aware of the {@link ReplicationService}
 * and understands the replication life cycle which can be in {@link ReplicationService#isReplicationStarting()
 * starting} mode, and furthermore each replicable can be in the process of handling its initial load. This tracker has
 * a specialized {@link #waitForService(long)} implementation that waits for the {@link ReplicationService} to not be in
 * state {@link ReplicationService#isReplicationStarting()}, waits for the replicable requested using the regular
 * (super-class) {@link ServiceTracker#waitForService(long)} method and asserts the {@link Replicable} to return is
 * not in the state {@link Replicable#isCurrentlyFillingFromInitialLoad()}.<p>
 * 
 * By analogy, the {@link #getService()} and related methods return only services for which the above rules apply.
 * In particular, {@link #getService()} will return {@code null} if the {@link ReplicationService} is currently in mode
 * {@link ReplicationService#isReplicationStarting()} or the replicable found by the regular OSGi tracker is currently
 * {@link Replicable#isCurrentlyFillingFromInitialLoad() receiving its initial load}.<p>
 * 
 * Note that {@link #waitForService(long)} must not be used during the activation of a {@link Replicable}'s bundle before
 * that {@link Replicable} has been registered with the OSGi registry. Otherwise, a deadlock can result because the waiting
 * {@link Replicable} will hold up the completion of the replication start-up and hence wait forever.
