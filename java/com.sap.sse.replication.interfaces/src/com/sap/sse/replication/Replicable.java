/**
 * Represents a replicable part of an application. Such a replicable part is usually holder of application state and a
 * transaction / operation processing unit. Processing {@link Operation operations} generally happens by
 * {@link Operation#applyTo(Object) applying} operations to this replicable. As such, this replicable plays the role of
 * the <code>toState</code> argument in the {@link Operation#applyTo(Object)} method calls.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In addition to being the operation processor, a replicable must be able to serialize its state for the initial load
 * of a replica, and it must be able to initialize its state from this serialized form. In doing so it is important to
 * not include state that is controlled by another replicable. References to such objects need to be <em>transient</em>
 * which means they are not serialized together with the initial load of this replica. If such references need to be
 * re-established after de-serialization then they need to represented by some key which can later be looked up in the
 * other replicable which can be discovered through the OSGi service registry on the receiving end.
 * <p>
 * 
 * For operation and initial load serialization, a replicable is provided an {@link InputStream} from which to read the
 * operations and the initial load. A typical implementation for reading the stream's contents will use a specialized
 * {@link ObjectInputStream} such as a specialization of {@link ObjectInputStreamResolvingAgainstCache} that ensures
 * that on the receiving end there are no two Java object copies representing the same domain object where this matters.
 * This is particularly important for objects with mutable state that otherwise may run inconsistent when only one of
 * the multiple copies gets modified. Typically, the object input stream uses some sort of cache and overrides the
 * {@link ObjectInputStream#resolveObject} method, and the types whose objects are de-serialized need to co-operate by
 * implementing a marker interface telling the specialized object input stream to use the cache when resolving objects
 * of that type.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Several {@link Replicable} instances can share the same replication service and the same set of replication channels.
 * In order to participate in replication, {@link Replicable} objects need to be registered as OSGi services for the
 * {@link Replicable} interface. The replication service will dynamically discover the {@link Replicable} objects when
 * initial load is requested and when an {@link Operation} is received. The initial load streams as well as each
 * replication operation need to identify the {@link Replicable} they refer to. This identification is added as an OSGi
 * service registry parameter that is used during service discovery.
 * <p>
 * 
 * To implement a new replicable, consider the following steps:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Consider using {@link AbstractReplicableWithObjectInputStream} as an abstract base class for your
 * {@link Replicable} implementation.</li>
 * <li>Implement the necessary methods, in particular ensuring that your
 * {@link ReplicableWithObjectInputStream#createObjectInputStreamResolvingAgainstCache(InputStream, Map)} implementation
 * returns an object whose class is loaded by your replicable's class loader, such as an in-place anonymous inner class
 * instantiation of the {@link ObjectInputStreamResolvingAgainstCache} class.</li>
 * <li>In your bundle's {@link BundleActivator activator} create your replicable instance and
 * {@link BundleContext#registerService(Class, Object, java.util.Dictionary) register it with the OSGi service registry}
 * under the {@link Replicable} service interface, like this:
 * <pre>
 *     final Dictionary&lt;String, String&gt; replicableServiceProperties = new Hashtable&lt;&gt;();
 *     replicableServiceProperties.put(Replicable.OSGi_Service_Registry_ID_Property_Name, service.getId().toString());
 *     registrations.add(context.registerService(Replicable.class.getName(), service, replicableServiceProperties));</pre></li>
 * <li>Add your replicable's fully-qualified class name to the {@code env-default-rules.sh} file where the
 * {@code REPLICATE_ON_START} variable has its default value defined.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @param <S>
 *            the type of state to which the operations are applied; usually this will be set to the implementing
 *            subclass
 * @param <O>
 *            type of operation that the replicable accepts; it is good practice to declare a dedicated interface for
 *            the operation type of each {@link Replicable} implementation class. This helps to avoid accidentally
 *            passing an operation intended for a different replicable service. Make sure to implement operation types
 *            as dedicated classes and withstand the temptation to use lambdas. While lambdas may work at first and look
 *            nice and compact, two major problems emerge (see also
 *            <a href="https://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5197">bug 5197</a>): you may
 *            unintentionally reference comprehensive contextual state in your lambda which then needs to get serialized
 *            with it; and by using {@link Serializable} lambdas, serialization compatibility is brittle because it
 *            depends on the lambda's position in its type, and hence code insertions, removals or changes in method
 *            ordering can already cause unnecessary incompatibilities. Specifically for {@link Replicable} services
 *            shared by many instances this should be avoided at any cost because incompatible changes then require
 *            upgrading the entire landscape.
