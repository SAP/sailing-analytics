/**
 * Competitor data may come from various sources, such as external regatta management systems (RMS),
 * CSV files, Excel spreadsheets and the like. When creating a regatta that uses "RaceLog Tracking"
 * (also known as Smartphone Tracking)---and be it only in order to manage results for the regatta
 * with the race committee app---it is tedious having to enter all competitor data manually when
 * that data is already available in electronic form.<p>
 * 
 * In its simplest form, a provider will just produce an otherwise unstructured list of competitor
 * entries with no hint as to the event, regatta or race that the competitor pertains to. More
 * sophisticated providers may structure competitor data into events, regattas or even individual
 * races so that importing these competitors into a single fleet of one race column becomes possible.
 * This will be particularly useful for split-fleet racing.
