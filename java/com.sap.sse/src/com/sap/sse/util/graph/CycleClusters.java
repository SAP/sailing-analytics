/**
 * When transforming a {@link DirectedGraph} into a directed acyclic graph using the
 * {@link DirectedGraph#graphWithCombinedCycleNodes()}, cycles are combined into
 * single nodes representing the cycles. In particular, if there is more than one cycle
 * with overlaps, those cycles are combined into a single node. When determining
 * {@link DirectedGraph#getLengthsOfLongestPathsFromRoot() distances from root nodes},
 * equal values are to be reported for all nodes in the same cycle cluster. For
 * clients it may be necessary to understand whether two nodes are on the same cycle
 * cluster. This interface helps in detecting this.
