/**
 * During de-serialization, resolves objects managed by a cache of type <C> using a cache of that type passed to the
 * constructor. Objects are identified as being managed by such a cache by means of the marker interface
 * {@link IsManagedByCache} that their classes then have to implement, telling how resolving against the cache
 * has to work for instances of that type.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Additionally, class loading is managed using the current thread's context class loader which is required in and works
 * well for OSGi environments.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Create an instance of this class by first creating a subclass in the bundle that has all the dependencies required to
 * resolve all the classes whose instances are to be read from the stream and then instantiating this subclass. Otherwise,
 * the stream won't be able to find the classes. To make this need clear, this class is declared <code>abstract</code>.
 * 
 * @param <C>
 *            the cache type used for resolving objects
