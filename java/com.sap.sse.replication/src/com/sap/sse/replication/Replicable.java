/**
 * Represents a replicable part of an application. Such a replicable part is usually holder of application state and a
 * transaction / operation processing unit. Processing {@link Operation operations} generally happens by
 * {@link Operation#applyTo(Object) applying} operations to this replicable. As such, this replicable plays the role of
 * the <code>toState</code> argument in the {@link Operation#applyTo(Object)} method calls.
 * <p>
 * 
 * In addition to being the operation processor, a replicable must be able to serialize its state for the initial load
 * of a replica, and it must be able to initialize its state from this serialized form. In doing so it is important to
 * not include state that is controlled by another replicable. References to such objects need to be <em>transient</em>
 * which means they are not serialized together with the initial load of this replica. If such references need to be
 * re-established after de-serialization then they need to represented by some key which can later be looked up in the
 * other replicable which can be discovered through the OSGi service registry on the receiving end.
 * <p>
 * 
 * For operation and initial load serialization, a replicable is provided an {@link InputStream} from which to read the
 * operations and the initial load. A typical implementation for reading the stream's contents will use a specialized
 * {@link ObjectInputStream} such as a specialization of {@link ObjectInputStreamResolvingAgainstCache} that ensures
 * that on the receiving end there are no two Java object copies representing the same domain object where this matters.
 * This is particularly important for objects with mutable state that otherwise may run inconsistent when only one of
 * the multiple copies gets modified. Typically, the object input stream uses some sort of cache and overrides the
 * {@link ObjectInputStream#resolveObject} method, and the types whose objects are de-serialized need to co-operate by
 * implementing a marker interface telling the specialized object input stream to use the cache when resolving objects
 * of that type.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Several {@link Replicable} instances can share the same replication service and the same set of replication channels.
 * In order to participate in replication, {@link Replicable} objects need to be registered as OSGi services for the
 * {@link Replicable} interface. The replication service will dynamically discover the {@link Replicable} objects when
 * initial load is requested and when an {@link Operation} is received. The initial load streams as well as each
 * replication operation need to identify the {@link Replicable} they refer to. This identification is added as an OSGi
 * service registry parameter that is used during service discovery.
 * 
 * @param <S>
 *            the type of state to which the operations are applied; usually this will be set to the implementing
 *            subclass
 * @param <O>
 *            type of operation that the replicable accepts
