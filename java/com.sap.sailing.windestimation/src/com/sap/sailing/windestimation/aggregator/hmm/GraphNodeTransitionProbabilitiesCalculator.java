     * For two maneuver classifications ({@code previousNode} and {@code currentNode}) estimates the probability of the

     * maneuver classifications leading up to the {@code previousNode}. The idea is that true wind direction changes
     * correlate with the time difference and distance between the measurements, with measurements in close time and
     * distance vicinity yielding similar results. Based on the core capability of guessing a true wind direction range
     * from a classified maneuver ({@link GraphNode#getValidWindRange()}, if the wind ranges of two subsequent maneuvers
     * don't match up, the likelihood of this to happen can be estimated based on the time difference and distance
     * between the two maneuvers. This probability is the {@link Pair#getB() second} component of the {@link Pair}
     * returned.
