The library smile-score-1.5.2.jar has been patched!!!
The class files smile.feature.FeatureTransform and smile.feature.Standardizer
were removed from jar in order to overwrite those classes and make them Serializable
(see com.sap.sailing.windestimation/src/smile/feature/). The removal was necessary
due to OSGI environment. The next release version of SMILE will already include
Serialization support for the aforementioned classes, which means that the patch will
be obsolete. When 1.5.3 comes out, replace the 1.5.2 jars with the official 1.5.3 jars.
Furthermore, delete com.sap.sailing.windestimation/src/smile folder with patched
source files.
