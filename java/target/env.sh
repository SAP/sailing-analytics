# This is a default heap size only; the boot script of an instance (see
# configuration/sailing) will add a MEMORY assignment to this file in the
# server's directory that has a default value computed from the total
# memory installed in the machine and the number of server instances to
# start on that machine. This default can be overwritten by manually appending
# another MEMORY assignment at the end of the file or by defining an environment
# file with a MEMORY assignment which is then used in conjunction with refreshInstance.sh
# or by setting the MEMORY variable in the EC2 Instance Details section which will be appended
# at the end of the file.
