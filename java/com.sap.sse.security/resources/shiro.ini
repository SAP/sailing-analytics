# filter parameter. This makes it different from the default roles[...] filter
# which requires the user to have ALL of the roles specified as parameters.

# A custom filter for GWT pages that require an authenticated user.
# Forwards unauthenticated users to the default login page. When
# addressed directly (and not based on a redirect), users who logged
# on successfully will be redirected to the UserManagement.html page
# where they can adjust their profile.

# It assumes that form-based login parameters are sent to the
# /api/restsecurity/login RESTlet and forwards successful login attempts
# to the /api/restsecurity/hello service which is expected to respond
# with a JSON document containing the authenticated subject's properties.

# This authentication filter accepts a bearer access token in the HTTP
# Authorization header field, as in
#   Authorization: Bearer 1029741026501365024376093245

# authentication ("Authentication: Basic ...") and then regular form-based
# authentication with POST parameters "username" and "password".
