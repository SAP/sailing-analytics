/**
 * Describes all the aspects of branding as it may show in various places, specifically in the UI.
 * This includes whether branding is active, but also various logos to be displayed in different contexts,
 * as well as links to imprints and privacy statements.<p>
 * 
 * This is a service interface that can be implemented by different OSGi bundles, allowing for different
 * branding configurations. They may even be deployed at the same time and switched at runtime. If no branding
 * configuration is found or selected, no reference to any branding will be made ("whitelabeled" mode).<p>
 * 
 * For web pages to react to the branding configuration, JSP (Java Server Pages) can be used. Use {@link ClienctConfigurationListener}
 * in your web bundle's {@code web.xml} file as follows to get branding properties mapped into the JSP context:
 * <pre>
 *     &lt;listener&gt;
 *        &lt;listener-class>com.sap.sse.branding.ClientConfigurationListener&lt;/listener-class&gt;
 *     &lt;/listener&gt;
 * </pre>
 * Needless to say that your web bundle then must import the {@code com.sap.sse.branding} package.<p>
