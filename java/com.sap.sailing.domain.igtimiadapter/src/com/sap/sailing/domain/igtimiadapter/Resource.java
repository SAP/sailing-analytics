 * You can think of resources really as meta-info - identifying time blocks of data that have some meaning. For an
 * Igtimi device it's a power cycle. However data access is not forced to be "through" a resource. If you only wanted to
 * get data from a specific resource then of course you would just use the start and end timestamps in the request.
 * Resources are meant to be non-overlapping, which is why this works. Although this is not strictly enforced...
