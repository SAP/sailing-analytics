The sources in here have been generated using the protobuf compiler for Java language bindings.
The compiler has been archived at https://static.sapsailing.com/protoc-28.3-linux-x86_64.zip.
The protobuf definition files have been taken from the Igtimi Github go-igtimi repository at
git@github.com:igtimi/go-igtimi.git. There, in the proto/ folder the message type definition files
(.proto file extension) can be found under com/igtimi/*.proto.

Use the compiler like this:

        protoc --java_out={your-git-root}/java/com.sap.sailing.domain.igtimiadapter/protobuf_generated/ com/igtimi/*.proto

The resulting files show hundreds of warnings based on unused identifiers, unnecessary warning
suppressions, and the like. We have adjusted the generated files manually to comply with our
coding standards.

The protobuf Java runtime library was taken from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protobuf-java/4.28.3/
which matches the compiler version (28.3). As usual, the sources JAR doesn't have a valid OSGi
source bundle manifest, so this needed manual adjustment, too. The Orbit bundle
com.google.protobuf in version 2.4.1 is useless as it's missing many classes required.
So the Maven-provided JARs need to be added to our "target-base" feature group in our
local base p2 repository definition which is part of our target platform.

The original .proto files used for code generation have been copied to the proto/ folder in the root of this bundle.
