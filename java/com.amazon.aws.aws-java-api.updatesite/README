This is the P2 update site project for http://p2.sapsailing.com/p2/aws-sdk.
Its sibling project com.amazon.aws.aws-java-api can be generated by running
  /java/com.amazon.aws.aws-java-api/createLocalAwsApiP2Repository.sh
It generates a .project file, loads all required JARs into a lib/folder
and established manifest, classpath and build.properties file so the project
can be built both, in Eclipse and with Maven.

See /java/com.amazon.aws.aws-java-api/README for further instructions.

See also /java/com.sap.sailing.targetplatform/scripts/uploadAwsApiRepositoryToServer.sh
for uploading the update site to the p2 repository at p2.sapsailing.com.
