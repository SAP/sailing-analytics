Note that the org.dom4j bundle has a patched MANIFEST.MF. In its original version
it has an Import-Package for javax.xml.bind with a version specifier version="[2.2,3)" but
this cannot be resolved against the JDK 8's versionless javax.xml.bind package.
Therefore, we remove the version specifier in the MANIFEST.MF manually and re-pack.
