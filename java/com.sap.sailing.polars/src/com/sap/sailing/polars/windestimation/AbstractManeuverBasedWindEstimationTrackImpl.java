     * <p>
     * 
     * All maneuvers of all competitors between start and end time are considered (usually race start and end for that
     * competitor, but may be the start of tracking, e.g., in case no course is set, and current time in case no finish
     * line mark passing is found for that competitor yet). Clustering the candidates by average COG should give two
     * clusters that are approximately 180deg apart from each other: one with the tacks and one with the jibes. A bunch
     * of other clusters will emerge for head-up/bear-away maneuvers with small course changes (one for each actual
     * tack/leg type combination), making them very unlikely candidates for maneuvers that have distinct wide expected
     * maneuver angles. Two more clusters typically emerge that hold the mark rounding maneuvers that have maneuver
     * angles similar to that of a typical tack and that would result in estimated wind directions offset by
     * approximately 90deg from the correct wind direction. Altogether this makes for eight expected clusters, two of
     * which are the interesting ones, four of which are expected to not contain likely candidates for the wide-angle
     * maneuvers (head-up/bear-away clusters), and the mark rounding clusters which to each other also tend to have a
     * 180deg offset.
     * <p>
     * 
     * Now for each cluster we check if it's the tack cluster. The tack cluster shows some characteristic features that
     * make it a little easier to identify: its maneuver angle is in most cases wider than that of the jibes, resulting
     * in two well-defined maneuver angle clusters (one for port-to-starboard and one for starboard-to-port tacks).
     * There are usually no other maneuvers with similar middle COG because boats can't sail straight against the wind.
     * <p>
     * 
     * We evaluate each cluster's likelihood of being the tack cluster by computing the average across all its maneuvers
     * for that maneuver being a tack, solely based on its speed and maneuver angle, as
     * {@link PolarDataService#getManeuverLikelihoodAndTwsTwa(BoatClass, Speed, double, ManeuverType) judged by the
     * polar service}. If a cluster exists that has approximately the opposite average middle COG (the jibe cluster
     * candidate), the {@link #getLikelihoodOfBeingJibeCluster(Speed, Stream, BoatClass, Set) likelihood for its
     * maneuvers being jibes} are determined and may result in a "boost" for the basic probability of up to 20%.
     * Finally, the resulting likelihood is multiplied by how likely the speed ratio between the tack and jibe cluster
     * candidates is, based on the polar diagram. For this task, the cluster's maneuvers' average speed (weighted by
     * each maneuver's likelihood of being a tack) is divided by that of the jibe cluster's maneuvers' average speed
     * (weighted by each maneuver's likelihood of being a jibe) and assigned a likelihood by the polar service.
     * <p>
     * 
     * The cluster that has the highest likelihood of being the tack cluster is selected. The confidence of the choice
     * depends on how clearly this cluster was the favorite among all clusters. For each of its maneuvers a wind fix is
     * generated with a confidence defined by the confidence of having picked the correct cluster as the tack cluster,
     * multiplied with the likelihood of the maneuver being a tack (as judged by the polar service). Similarly, each
     * maneuver from the jibe cluster is turned into a wind fix whose confidence results from the likelihood of the
     * maneuver being a jibe (based on the polar service's judgement) and the general confidence of the correct jibe
     * cluster having been selected.
     * <p>
     * 
     * One benefit of looking primarily for the tacks is that boats cannot sail straight against the wind. Therefore,
     * there usually are almost no maneuvers that have the same middle COG with a maneuver angle that resembles that of
     * the other maneuvers in the cluster. This way, the tack cluster will show two cleanly separated clusters along the
     * maneuver angle dimension that show low variance each, compared to all other clusters.
     * <p>
     * 
     * TODO with enough candidates at hand, apply temporal and spatial segmentation to account for heterogeneous wind
     * fields
