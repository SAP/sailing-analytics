 - IPositionedItem.getMetadata() didn't get the content from the parameters file
 (Reported by Axel Uhl, 19/11/2024)

********************************************
        TracAPI 4.0.0
********************************************
This is the final version. It changes the model of objects and is not compatible with versions 3.x.x.

The IControl interface represents "controls" that are part of a route. Competitors pass through these "controls"
during their race. However, in some sports, particularly in sailing, a control may consist of one or more "buoys."
To accommodate this, the TracTrac API introduces the concept of IControlPoint, which represents all the points
that make up a control.

The current TracTrac model, however, does not differentiate between "control" and "control point." In TracTrac,
everything is treated as a control, which can either be singular (if attached to a tracking device)
or composite (if represented by multiple controls). This model has a significant limitation: a tracking device
cannot be attached to two or more controls simultaneously.

To work around this limitation, the concept of a Virtual Tracker was introduced. A Virtual Tracker is a virtual tracking
device that retrieves positions from a real tracking device. However, this approach created a secondary issue:
the positions of a physical device were duplicated multiple times, significantly increasing the volume of data
transmitted between the server and clients.

This new TracAPI has been designed with the primary goal of eliminating the concept of Virtual Trackers. A secondary
objective has been to support additional race objects that are neither competitors nor controls, such as offset marks,
boundaries, wind sensors, etc.

The new API introduces two key interfaces:

1) com.tractrac.model.lib.api.map.IPositionedItem: Represents items with an attached position, either from a tracker
or a static location. These objects are not rendered in the viewer; they represent "a concept of an object with a
position on the map."

2) com.tractrac.model.lib.api.map.IMapItem: Represents tangible objects that can be drawn in the viewer. They consist
of one or more IPositionedItems, which are used to render them on the map.

Breaking Changes from Version 3.x.x

- com.tractrac.model.lib.api.route.IControl has been replaced by com.tractrac.model.lib.api.map.IMapItem.
- com.tractrac.model.lib.api.route.IControlPoint has been replaced by com.tractrac.model.lib.api.map.IPositionedItem.
- com.tractrac.model.lib.api.route.IControlRoute.getControls() now returns an array of IMapItems.
- com.tractrac.model.lib.api.data.IControlPassing.getControl() now returns an IMapItem.
- com.tractrac.model.lib.api.event.IEvent.getControls() has been removed. Use IEvent.getMapItems() or
 IEvent.getPositionedItems() instead.
- com.tractrac.model.lib.api.event.IEvent.getControl(UUID controlId) has been removed. Use IEvent.getMapItem(UUID mapItemId)
 instead.
- com.tractrac.subscription.lib.api.IEventSubscriber.subscribeControls(IControlsListener) has been replaced by
IEventSubscriber.subscribeMapItems(IMapItemsListener).
- com.tractrac.subscription.lib.api.IEventSubscriber.unsubscribeControls(IControlsListener) has been replaced
by IEventSubscriber.unsubscribeMapItems(IMapItemsListener).
- com.tractrac.subscription.lib.api.IRaceSubscriber.subscribeControlPositions(IControlPointPositionListener) has been
 replaced by IRaceSubscriber.subscribePositionedItemPositions(IPositionedItemPositionListener).
- com.tractrac.subscription.lib.api.IRaceSubscriber.unsubscribeControlPositions(IControlPointPositionListener) has been
 replaced by IRaceSubscriber.unsubscribePositionedItemPositions(IPositionedItemPositionListener).
- com.tractrac.subscription.lib.api.control.IControlsListener has been replaced by
com.tractrac.subscription.lib.api.map.IMapItemsListener. All methods have also been updated: updateControl → updateMapItem,
addControl → addMapItem, deleteControl → deleteMapItem
- com.tractrac.subscription.lib.api.control.IControlPointPositionListener has been replaced by
 com.tractrac.subscription.lib.api.map.IPositionedItemPositionListener. The sole method in this interface
 now returns the position of the IPositionedItem.

Why IControl was renamed to IMapItem?

The new API adopts a more generic model for objects. An IMapItem can now serve multiple purposes, such as being
 part of a course or forming part of a line to define race boundaries. In this initial version, all IMapItems
 are used as "controls." However, this will evolve in future iterations to support broader use cases.

        TracAPI 3.15.13
********************************************
This is a final version. It keeps the backward compatibility.

  Release date: 26/07/2024

 1) Bugs

- When a new race is added to the event, TracAPI receives a message with some information about the race. However, this
 message does not include the location of the parameters file. TracAPI attempts to infer the URI using HTTP (instead
 of HTTPS). This can cause a deadlock in locations where HTTP is not allowed (e.g., the Olympic Games) because TracAPI is
 trying to download an invalid parameters file. From now on, TracAPI will infer the URI using HTTPS. This is a
 temporary solution. The final solution will be to include the URI of the parameters file in the original message.

 1) Bugs

- If the parameters file has an MTB and the user overwrites the stored-uri with another value, the library ignores the
 user parameter and gives priority to the MTB file. And it doesn't matter if the provided stored-uri is a dataserver
 port or an MTB: the library is always ignoring this parameter. This is a bug. Now, if the user uses an MTB file,
 this file will always be used and the library will only force the usage of the MTB file if the user overwrites
 the stored-uri using a dataserver port. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 20/06/2024)

changes in the implementation.

This version provides a new JavaDoc version.

Release date: 28/07/2017
Build number: 14122

 1) Features

 - RaceCompetitorStatusType: New race competitor status type defined: F_CONFIRMED. Represents a competitor with a
 control passing registered for the last gate/mark that is accepted as the official result (Requested by Ugo
 Alvazzi, 26/04/2017)
 - WebSockets support: instead of using a TCP connection is possible to retrieve data using WebSockets (using the
 same protocol used by the HTML Viewer). The protocol is not fully implemented and it only has to be used for testing
 (Requested by Jorge Piera, 30/04/2017).
 - Use an asynchronous API: the dataserver implementation has been migrated to an asynchronous API that provides
 a better performance downloading replay data (the tests show that is 2.5 times faster). TracAPI has also adopted
 this new asynchronous interface but at this moment it continues using the synchronous approach (Requested by Jorge
 Piera, 03/05/2017)
 - Adding the method ISubscriberFactory.clean to release the objects in memory (Requested by Andr? Borud, 01/06/2017)
 - Adding the method IPosition.isGPSTiming to know is the time of a position has been retrieved from a physical
 GPS device (Requested by J?rome Soussens, 21/06/2017)

 2) Bugs

 - When a static control is updated, the IControlPointPositionListener.gotControlPointPosition event
 is not called if the consumer application is not registered to the IEventSubscriber (Reported by
 Axel Uhl, 18/06/2017)
 - The live delay sometimes is not propagated. The server always propagates the event but TracAPI can
 filter it if the IEventSubscriber is not being used or if it has not been correctly initialized

 2) Bugs

 - If the consumer application is not subscribed to the events that manage the addition of new "objects"
 in the system (e.g: add control, add competitor...), it is never going to receive the events related
 with these "objects". It is an error of design in TracAPI because it has been designed "thinking"
 that the consumer application is always subscribed to receive all the events. The solution is simple:
 TracAPI is always going to subscribe to all the events to guarantee that the static model is always
 updated and to guarantee that if the consumer application is subscribed to a type of event it is always
 going to receive all the events of this type. There is a secondary effect: the consumer application can
 receive events with new objects. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 20/07/2015)

Release date: 27/05/2015
Build number: 10715

 1) Features

 - Adding the method IRace.setInitialized(boolean) that allows to load control point positions despite of
 the race is not initialized (Requested by Jorge Piera, 17/05/2015)

 1) Bugs

  - The subscription library sends (per each control point) an "ControlPointPosition" event with the positions
 of the parameters with a time stamp equals to the tracking start time. If the control  point is static (it
 doesn't have a tracker), it means that this control won't exist until the tracking start time arrives: it is
 not possible to open a subscription connection before the tracking start time and see the control point. But
 if the control is static,  it has to exist during all the event. Now when a control is static, the subscription
 library sends a "ControlPointPosition" event with the event start time and then it sends other "ControlPointPosition"
 event with the tracking start time. It allows to connect with future races and see the static controls (Requested
 by Jakob Odum, 25/02/2015)

 - It is possible to add two or more subscriptions for the same subscriber (Reported by Jorge Piera, 02/05/2015)

 - An initialized race is a race where the tracking is on. A not initialized race is a race where the tracking is off.
 If a race is in a not initialized state and it is loaded using the parameters file, the library assumes that the
 consumer application wants to load the race and it changes its initialized  attribute to true (the tracking is on).
 This assumption is wrong. Now, if a race is not initialized it will continue being uninitialized until the event
 administrator changes its state to initialized.
   When a race changes its state from not initialized to initialized, some events are thrown in the system:
     1. IRaceStartStopTimesChangeListener.gotTrackingStartStopTime(IRace, IStartStopData): where the IStartStopData object contains the new tracking interval.
     2. IRacesListener.startTracking(UUID): the UUID is the race identifier
     3. IRacesListener.updateRace(IRace): IRace is the new updated race where the IRace.isInitialized is true and it has values for both the getTrackingStartTime and the getTrackingEndTime methods.
   When a race changes its state from initialized to not initialized, the following events are thrown in the system:
     1. IRaceStartStopTimesChangeListener.gotTrackingStartStopTime(IRace, IStartStopData): where the IStartStopData object contains the null interval ([0, 0])
     2. IRacesListener.abandonRace(UUID): the UUID is the race identifier
     3. IRacesListener.updateRace(IRace): IRace is the new updated race where the IRace.isInitialized is false and it has null values for both the getTrackingStartTime and the getTrackingEndTime methods.

Release date: 19/11/2014
Build number: 9436

1) New features

 - The IRace interface implements the method getStartTimeType that returns the type of start time. It is an enumerated
 value with the values: Individual (if the competitors have an individual start time), RaceStart (if the race
 has a race start time) and FirstControl (if the start of the race happens when the competitor passes for
 the first control). The value by default is RaceStart. At this moment this value only can be managed at an event
 level (in the event manager) but in a future we will add this functionality at a race level (Requested by
 J�rome Soussens, 14/10/2014)
 - The method IControlPoint.getPosition is deprecated. Use the IControlPointPositionListener.gotControlPointPosition()
 to know the position of a control point (Reported by Jorge Piera, 28/10/2014)
 - Adding the isNonCompeting() method to the ICompetitor interface. If a competitor is a non competing competitor
 doesn't receive control passings attached to it. It only receives positions (Requested by J?rome Soussens, 15/10/2014 and
 Axel Uhl, 22/10/2014)

2) Bugs

 - It checks that the system of messages doesn't generates a BufferOverflow exception. We added a bug on the server
 sending wrong strings to the clients and this error thrown an exception on the clients that killed one of threads.
 Now the tracapi checks if there is an error encoding the strings and in this case, logs the exeption discarding
 the message but the thread, continues running. Anyway the error has been fixed in the server side. (Reported by
 Jorge Piera, 30/09/2014)
 - If there is a control point without coordinates the lat,lon values are not included in the parameters file
 and the library doesn't create the IControlPoint. Now, the library creates the IControlPoint and it returns
 the values Double.MAX_VALUE for both the lat and the lon. This position is not sent by the
 IControlPointPositionListener.gotControlPointPosition(). (Reported by Jakob Odum, 28/10/2014)
 - There is a synchronization bug registering and sending messages using the General Message System. The list
 that is used to register the listeners is not a synchronized list. This bug has been fixed (Reported by Axel Uhl, 19/11/2014,

********************************************
    TracAPI 3.0.6
********************************************
This is a final version. It fixes bugs in the implementation and it adds a new feature.
This new feature adds methods to the API, but it keeps the backward compatibility.
This version provides a new JavaDoc version.

Release date: 11/08/2014

1) New features

 - The IRaceCompetitor implements the IMetadataContainer interface (Requested by Frank Mittag, 16/07/2014)

2) Bugs

 - The race name and the visibility are not updated in the IRacesListener.update() method.
 (Reported by Jorge Piera, 06/08/2014)
 - The IRaceCompetitor doesn't contains the associated IRoute object (Reported by Jorge Piera, 08/08/2014)
 - Changing the synchronization of the maps in the EventFactory (Reported by Axel Uhl, 09/08/2014)


********************************************
    TracAPI 3.0.5
********************************************
This is a final version. Only fixes bugs in the implementation

Release date: 05/08/2014

1) Bugs

 - The previous version 3.0.4 added only changes in the synchronization. The lists were synchronized by hand
 but the implementation continued using synchronized lists. The result was that we had a double
 synchronization for all the lists of the model: the synchronization by hand and the synchronization of
 the list. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 04/08/2014)
 - The new subscription library sends the static positions (from the parameters file) as positions events.
 The problem here is that the subscription library retrieves the positions from the model of control
 points and  when some races are loaded in parallel these values can be invalid (values loaded by
 other race). Now the subscription library sends the static positions from the parameters file.
 (Reported by Jorge Piera, 04/08/2014)


********************************************
    TracAPI 3.0.4
********************************************
This is a final version. Only fixes bugs in the implementation

Release date: 04/08/2014

1) Bugs

 - Some lists are not thread-safety. The model project exposes some lists based on a
 CopyOnWriteArrayList implementation that is thread-safety if you get its iterator.
 But if before to invoke the iterator() method of the list, other thread is editing the list,
 it is possible to get a list in an invalid status. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 31/07/2014)


********************************************
    TracAPI 3.0.3
********************************************
This is a final version. Only fixes bugs in the implementation

Release date: 25/07/2014

1) Bugs

 - When a race is reloaded more than one time it keeps the entries despite of they have been removed. The new entries
 are correctly added but the removed competitors are kept. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 25/07/2014)


********************************************
    TracAPI 3.0.2
********************************************
This is a final version. Only fixes bugs in the implementation

Release date: 24/07/2014

1) New features

 - The IRacesListener.updateRace() event is thrown when the live delay for a race has changed. The IRace.getLiveDelay() method
 returns the new value.

2) Bugs

 - The events IRacesListener.abandonRace() and IRacesListener.startTracking() have been reviewed. Now they are always sent
 when the races are updated either using the event manager or using the external JSON service "update_race_status"
 - The controls are not updated when they are retrieved a second time from a parameters file. The library always returns
 the first control that was read the first time. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 24/07/2014)

********************************************
    TracAPI 3.0.1
********************************************
This is a final version. Only fixes bugs in the implementation

Release date: 09/06/2014

1) Bugs

 - Error reading JSON of races.

********************************************
    TracAPI 3.0.0
********************************************
This is a final version.

Release date: 04/06/2014

1) New features

 - The positions of the static marks are sent like an event
 - The static start/end tracking times and the static start/end race times are sent like an events
 - The static course is sent like an event
 - The IConnectionListener.stopped() method uses an object as argument
 - The start/end tracking times are 0l if the race has not been initialized
 - Added the IRaceListener.startTracking event
 - Added the IRace.getExpectedRaceStartDate()
 - Added the IRace.isInitialized()
 - Added the IRace.getVisibility()

2) Bugs

 - Error reading the race start time from the JSON
 - Synchonizating the locators used to retrieve objects using the Service Provider Interface

********************************************
    TracAPI 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT
********************************************

This is an SNAPSHOT version that means that is a version that has not been released (is under development).

1) Bugs

 - The route name is lost when the ControlRouteChange event is thrown
 - Adding synchronized lists in some objects of the model that were not synchronized
 - Fixing an error using a local parameters file with a local MTB file
 - Fixing several errors marshaling the objects then an static property has been changed
 - Fixing a bug parsing a JSON with races that has races without params_url (for Orienteering events)
