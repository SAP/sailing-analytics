************* TracAPI 3.2.2 ****************
********************************************
This is a final version. It fixes bugs in the implementation and it adds a some features.
These features add methods to the API, but they keep the backward compatibility.
This version provides a new JavaDoc version.

Release date: 21/09/2016
Build number: 12927

1) Features

 - Adding the method ISubscriber.isRunning() to know if the thread created by the ISubscriber.start() method
 is running or not (Requested by Jorge Piera, 04/08/2016).

 - Added attribute in the IRaceCompetitor interface: statusTime. It will contain the time when an entry has changed
 its status to abandoned/retired.

 - Added new value to the RaceCompetitorStatusType enum: NO_COLLECT. This value means that the competitor didn't
 collected the tracker.

2) Bugs

 - When an static control is added (or updated), the timestamp has to be the event start time. At this moment
  it is using the timestamp when whe control was created (Reported by Steffen Wagner, 12/09/2016)

********************************************
************* TracAPI 3.1.0 ****************
********************************************
This is a final version. It fixes bugs in the implementation and it adds some new features. 
These features add methods to the API breaking the backward compatibility. These changes are:

 - The IRaceCompetitorListener interface implements a new method removeOffsetPositions. If 
 your app implements this interface, you have to implement this extra method.  
 
This version provides a new JavaDoc version.

Release date: 11/12/2015
Build number: 11801

 1) Features
 
   - Adding the method IRaceCompetitorListener.removeOffsetPositions that is invoked
  to invalidate a set of positions. It is used when the event administrator detects 
  an error in the snapping algorithm (in route sports) and he want to remove the wrong
  positions (Requested by Chris Terkelsen, 26/11/2015)
 
  - Adding the method IControl.getMapName() that contains the name that has to be used to
  display the control on the map (Requested by Chris Terkelsen, 09/12/2015)
    
 2) Bugs
 
  - The static controls send a position event using the race start time instead the 
  event start time. (Reported by Jerome Soussens, 11/12/2015)

Release date: 07/08/2015
Build number: 11130

 1) Features
 
 - Adding the method ISubscriberFactory.setUserId(userId) used to configure a valid user with permissions
 to retrieve data from the TracTrac servers. (Requested by Jorge Piera, 18/06/2015)
 
 2) Bugs
 
 - If the consumer application is not subscribed to the events that manage the addition of new "objects" 
 in the system (e.g: add control, add competitor...), it is never going to receive the events related 
 with these "objects". It is an error of design in TracAPI because it has been designed "thinking"
 that the consumer application is always subscribed to receive all the events. The solution is simple: 
 TracAPI is always going to subscribe to all the events to guarantee that the static model is always 
 updated and to guarantee that if the consumer application is subscribed to a type of event it is always 
 going to receive all the events of this type. There is a secondary effect: the consumer application can 
 receive events with new objects. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 20/07/2015)

Release date: 27/05/2015
Build number: 10715

 1) Features 
 
 - Adding the method IRace.setInitialized(boolean) that allows to load control point positions despite of
 the race is not initialized (Requested by Jorge Piera, 17/05/2015)
 
 1) Bugs 
 
  - The subscription library sends (per each control point) an "ControlPointPosition" event with the positions 
 of the parameters with a time stamp equals to the tracking start time. If the control  point is static (it 
 doesn't have a tracker), it means that this control won't exist until the tracking start time arrives: it is 
 not possible to open a subscription connection before the tracking start time and see the control point. But 
 if the control is static,  it has to exist during all the event. Now when a control is static, the subscription 
 library sends a "ControlPointPosition" event with the event start time and then it sends other "ControlPointPosition"
 event with the tracking start time. It allows to connect with future races and see the static controls (Requested 
 by Jakob Odum, 25/02/2015)
   
 - It is possible to add two or more subscriptions for the same subscriber (Reported by Jorge Piera, 02/05/2015)
 
 - An initialized race is a race where the tracking is on. A not initialized race is a race where the tracking is off.
 If a race is in a not initialized state and it is loaded using the parameters file, the library assumes that the 
 consumer application wants to load the race and it changes its initialized  attribute to true (the tracking is on).
 This assumption is wrong. Now, if a race is not initialized it will continue being uninitialized until the event 
 administrator changes its state to initialized.
   When a race changes its state from not initialized to initialized, some events are thrown in the system:
     1. IRaceStartStopTimesChangeListener.gotTrackingStartStopTime(IRace, IStartStopData): where the IStartStopData object contains the new tracking interval.
     2. IRacesListener.startTracking(UUID): the UUID is the race identifier
     3. IRacesListener.updateRace(IRace): IRace is the new updated race where the IRace.isInitialized is true and it has values for both the getTrackingStartTime and the getTrackingEndTime methods.
   When a race changes its state from initialized to not initialized, the following events are thrown in the system:
     1. IRaceStartStopTimesChangeListener.gotTrackingStartStopTime(IRace, IStartStopData): where the IStartStopData object contains the null interval ([0, 0])
     2. IRacesListener.abandonRace(UUID): the UUID is the race identifier
     3. IRacesListener.updateRace(IRace): IRace is the new updated race where the IRace.isInitialized is false and it has null values for both the getTrackingStartTime and the getTrackingEndTime methods.

******************************************** 
This is a final version. Only fixes bugs in the implementation

Release date: 17/02/2015
Build number: 9938
 
 1) Bugs
 
 - It fixes the same bug described in the release 3.0.9 that it was not fixed. The release 3.0.9 fixed
 the synchronization issue between different threads but the ConcurrentModificationException happens
 when the same thread is accessing to the list. The synchronization at method level doesn't work
 in this case (Reported by Axel Uhl,07/02/2015)

 1) New features
 
 - Adding the method IEvent.getEventType that returns the type of the event (e.g: Sailing, Orienteering...).
 (Requested by Jorge Piera, 01/02/2014)
 
 2) Bugs
 
 - The changes in the static fields of the route (including the metadata) were not propagated through 
 the subscription library. Following the same approach used for the races, controls and competitors, 
 a new listener IRoutesListener has been added to manage these changes.  (Reported by Axel Uhl,

This version provides a new JavaDoc version.

Release date: 19/11/2014
Build number: 9436

1) New features

 - The IRace interface implements the method getStartTimeType that returns the type of start time. It is an enumerated 
 value with the values: Individual (if the competitors have an individual start time), RaceStart (if the race
 has a race start time) and FirstControl (if the start of the race happens when the competitor passes for
 the first control). The value by default is RaceStart. At this moment this value only can be managed at an event
 level (in the event manager) but in a future we will add this functionality at a race level (Requested by 
 Jérome Soussens, 14/10/2014)  
 - The method IControlPoint.getPosition is deprecated. Use the IControlPointPositionListener.gotControlPointPosition()
 to know the position of a control point (Reported by Jorge Piera, 28/10/2014)   
 - Adding the isNonCompeting() method to the ICompetitor interface. If a competitor is a non competing competitor
 doesn't receive control passings attached to it. It only receives positions (Requested by Jérome Soussens, 15/10/2014 and
 Axel Uhl, 22/10/2014) 

2) Bugs

 - It checks that the system of messages doesn't generates a BufferOverflow exception. We added a bug on the server
 sending wrong strings to the clients and this error thrown an exception on the clients that killed one of threads.
 Now the tracapi checks if there is an error encoding the strings and in this case, logs the exeption discarding
 the message but the thread, continues running. Anyway the error has been fixed in the server side. (Reported by 
 Jorge Piera, 30/09/2014)   
 - If there is a control point without coordinates the lat,lon values are not included in the parameters file
 and the library doesn't create the IControlPoint. Now, the library creates the IControlPoint and it returns
 the values Double.MAX_VALUE for both the lat and the lon. This position is not sent by the 
 IControlPointPositionListener.gotControlPointPosition(). (Reported by Jakob Odum, 28/10/2014)    
 - There is a synchronization bug registering and sending messages using the General Message System. The list
 that is used to register the listeners is not a synchronized list. This bug has been fixed (Reported by Axel Uhl, 19/11/2014,
 http://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2474)

********************************************
************* TracAPI 3.0.5 ****************
********************************************
This is a final version. Only fixes bugs in the implementation

Release date: 05/08/2014

1) Bugs

 - The previous version 3.0.4 added only changes in the synchronization. The lists were synchronized by hand
 but the implementation continued using synchronized lists. The result was that we had a double
 synchronization for all the lists of the model: the synchronization by hand and the synchronization of
 the list. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 04/08/2014)   
 - The new subscription library sends the static positions (from the parameters file) as positions events.
 The problem here is that the subscription library retrieves the positions from the model of control 
 points and  when some races are loaded in parallel these values can be invalid (values loaded by 
 other race). Now the subscription library sends the static positions from the parameters file. 
 (Reported by Jorge Piera, 04/08/2014)

 - Some lists are not thread-safety. The model project exposes some lists based on a 
 CopyOnWriteArrayList implementation that is thread-safety if you get its iterator. 
 But if before to invoke the iterator() method of the list, other thread is editing the list,
 it is possible to get a list in an invalid status. (Reported by Axel Uhl, 31/07/2014)
