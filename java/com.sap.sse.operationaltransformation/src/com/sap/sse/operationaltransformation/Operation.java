     * return an otherwise inappropriate key that may differ across operations even though those operations would block
     * each other then this can cause performance degradations on the replicas where blocked operations clog the thread
     * pool used for running these asynchronous operations.
     * <p>
     * 
     * The result of this operation is used when scheduling the operation for execution. Those with equal keys will
     * be scheduled to execute sequentially within a single thread at any time, leaving the thread pools remaining threads

     *         may result in less "spread" across the thread pool available on the replicas' side than may be possible
     *         by a finer-grained key returned by specializing classes. Implementations should return more specific
     *         objects that should be {@link Object#equals(Object) equal} if their respective operations may block each
     *         other. Of course, a consistent {@link Object#hashCode()} implementation must exist for any specific
     *         {@link Object#equals(Object)} implementation. For example, an operation for inserting GPS fixes into a
     *         competitor's track within a race should return a key consisting of components identifying the competitor
