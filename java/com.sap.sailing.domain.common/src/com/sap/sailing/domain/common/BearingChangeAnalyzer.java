     *            tells how far and to which direction the course was changed. Positive values mean a change to
     *            {@link NauticalSide#STARBOARD}, negative values to {@link NauticalSide#PORT}. This is required to
     *            understand over which side the competitor reached the new course from the old course; if could have
     *            been either way. Example: if the <code>courseBeforeManeuver</code> was 355deg and the
     *            <code>courseAfterManeuver</code> was 005deg then if the <code>totalCourseChangeInDegrees</code> was
     *            positive then the competitor passed the 000deg course, whereas had the
     *            <code>totalCourseChangeInDegrees</code> been negative and less than 370deg then the competitor would
     *            have passed the 180deg course but not the 000deg course.
     * @return the number of times that the course identified by
     *         <code>wasThisCourseReachedAndCrossedDuringManeuver</code> was crossed; <code>0</code> means it was not
     *         crossed; any positive number tells how many times it was crossed, otherwise. Numbers greater than
     *         <code>1</code> require <code>totalCourseChangeInDegrees</code> to be greater than 360 degrees.
