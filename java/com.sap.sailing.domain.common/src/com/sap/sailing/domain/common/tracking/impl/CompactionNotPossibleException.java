/**
 * Throws when an attempt is made to turn a fix of some sort into a more compact form, probably
 * slightly reducing accuracy and/or reducing value ranges, such as for the speeds possible, where
 * the fix presented cannot be turned into its compact form without exceeding a range. This would
 * lead to an overflow or wrap-around and cannot be tolerated. Clients need to handle this exception
 * by skipping compaction and using the original fix instead.
