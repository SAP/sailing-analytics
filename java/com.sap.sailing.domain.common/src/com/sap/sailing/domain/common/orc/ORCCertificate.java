/**
 * Represents semantically a real ORC certificate for a {@link Competitor}, which is used to rate different type of
 * boats for different inshore and offshore race conditions.
 * <p>
 * An ORC certificate is issued by the "Member National Authorities" of World Sailing and are available for insight at
 * https://www.orc.org/index.asp . Other information about the whole scoring system and different variants are available
 * too.
 * <p>
 * One implementing class provides all necessary functionalities to score the Competitors with a choosen
 * {@link RankingMetric}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The {@link WithID} interface is to be implemented based on the {@link #getReferenceNumber()} which is unique across the
 * ORC world-wide certificate database. Note that the {@link #getBoatKey()} consisting of the {@link #getFileId()} and the
 * {@link #getIssuingCountry()} field values is a unique key for the boat to which the certificate belongs.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The certificate contains time allowances (or, conversely, speed predictions) for a combination of true wind speeds
 * (TWS) and true wind angles (TWA). There are defaults for the values used for the true wind speeds and the true wind
 * angles, forming a regular, fully populated matrix of allowances / speed predictions. These defaults can be found in
 * {@link #ALLOWANCES_TRUE_WIND_SPEEDS} and {@link #ALLOWANCES_TRUE_WIND_SPEEDS}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Certificates may also specify non-default values for the slots or "bins" of the matrix that describes the allowances
 * / speed predictions. As for the default values, the allowances matrix has to be fully populated. The values in the
 * TWS and TWA arrays are expected to be increasing monotonously.
