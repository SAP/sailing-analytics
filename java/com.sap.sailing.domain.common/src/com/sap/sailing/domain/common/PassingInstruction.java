/**
 * There are multiple ways a boat can pass a Waypoint. Two marks are either a Line that has to be crossed or a Gate,
 * where either of the the marks can be rounded. A single mark usually has to be passed on Port or Starboard. On rare
 * occasions an Offset mark can be laid out close to another mark to avoid collisions around that mark. The Offset mark
 * does not count as a Waypoint and does not start an own Leg. Sometimes a single mark has an absolute Bearing, leading
 * to a line that has to be crossed.
