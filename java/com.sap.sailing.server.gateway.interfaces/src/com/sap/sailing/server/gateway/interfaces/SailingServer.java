/**
 * Represents a remote instance of a server process or an entire application replica set with a master and zero or more
 * replicas, running the Sailing Analytics, and exposes various methods as a convenient Java API which are implemented
 * using the remote server's REST API. In short, this is a Java facade for a REST API.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Objects of this type manage authentication information required for executing its methods as part of their immutable
 * state, therefore at object construction time. Authentication information may be provided in the form of
 * username/password which can then be used to obtain a bearer token for remote access. Or the bearer token for the
 * server can be provided explicitly. Or, as the default, the constructor checks whether running in the scope of an
 * authenticated session and then uses that session user's bearer token, assuming that the server to be represented by
 * this object shares its security service with the server where this object is constructed.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Constructs objects whose type conforms with this interface by using {@link SailingServerFactory}.
