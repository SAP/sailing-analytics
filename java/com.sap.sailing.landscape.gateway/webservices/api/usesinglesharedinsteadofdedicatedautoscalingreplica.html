<h1>SAP Sailing Analytics Webservices API Version 1.0</h1>
<h2>URL: /sailinglandscape/api/landscape/usesinglesharedinsteadofdedicatedautoscalingreplica</h2>

<b>Description:</b>
 <p>  For an existing replica set ensures that there is a replica running and ready that is not an auto-scaling replica
      on a dedicated instance. If no such replica process is found, one is launched on a shared instance in an
      availability zone different from the one hosting the replica set's master instance. Once the non-auto-scaling
      replica is ready, the auto-scaling group's {@link AutoScalingGroup#minSize() minimum size} is reduced to 0 so
      that with no excess workload the auto-scaling group will terminate all auto-scaling group-managed instances.<p>
      
      Should a new shared instance be required for a new replica, its instance type is obtained from the one hosting
      the replica set's master process, silently assuming that it may already be on a shared set-up.

        <td>Optional form parameters:</td>
        <td>
            <div><tt>keyName</tt>, the name of the SSH key to use; must identify an existing SSH key by that name in the region specified
                          and will be used to log on to existing and new instances using a root ssh connection. If not specified, the
                          key used to launch an instance will be used for trying to connect to it, and a private key with matching name
                          for the respective region will be looked up.</div>
            <div><tt>replicaReplicationBearerToken</tt>, the bearer token the replica to launch on a shared instance will use to replicate its master server; defaults to the
                                               bearer token of the user authenticated for this request. Note that this requires the
                                               server processing this request to share the security information from security-service.sapsailing.com, too.</div>
            <div><tt>sharedInstanceType</tt>, instance type to use in the hyperscaler for a new shared replica instance. Defaults to the instance type of
                                              the instance hosting the replica set's master process.</div>
            <div><tt>memoryInMegabytes</tt>, can be used to specify the absolute amount of heap size used for the Java VM running the replica on the shared instance;
                                    if not specified, memoryTotalSizeFactor may be used (see below); if that isn't used either, heap size
                                    is computed based on the amount of memory available on the instance, not considering any swap space available.</div>
            <div><tt>memoryTotalSizeFactor</tt>, can be used if memoryInMegabytes is not used; it roughly specifies how many processes are intended to be run on the
                                        host; e.g., if 4 is specified, approximately 1/4 of the physical memory available (not considering swap space) is
                                        assigned as the process's heap space. If neither memoryInMegabytes nor memoryTotalSizeFactor are specified then
                                        the amount of memory is calculated automatically based on the amount of physical memory available on the host.</div>
            <div><tt>timeoutInMilliseconds</tt>, timeout in milliseconds to wait for responses from nodes when analyzing the replica sets
                                existing in the region; if not specified, a typical default for waiting for process responses will be used.</div>
