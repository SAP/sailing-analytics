/**
 * Subclasses can be used to retrieve messages through an HTTP connection. The connection remains open until the client
 * closes the request stream. Of course, network errors can occur, so the connection may be closed for other reasons,
 * too. The client may not necessarily become aware of the connection breaking. Therefore, clients can send the string
 * "<ping>" terminated with a newline character through the request stream, and this servlet will respond with the
 * message "<pong>" on the output stream. The ping/pong messages interleave the message stream but never cut a single
 * message into several parts.
