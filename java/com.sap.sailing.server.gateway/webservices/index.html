<h1>SAP Sailing Analytics - REST API - Web Services Overview</h1>

<p>
A number of web services are available for the SAP Sailing Analytics. 
Note that different server instances exist, and not all servers hold the same data. Usually, events get
their own URL which is then made sure to point to an application server cluster holding the data for that event.
So, <a href="http://www.sapsailing.com">www.sapsailing.com</a> may end up on a different server instance than
<a href="http://tw2013.sapsailing.com">tw2013.sapsailing.com</a>
or <a href="http://ess40-2013.sapsailing.com">ess40-2013.sapsailing.com</a>. Usually, we hand out a per-event
or per-series URL, such as the ones above (except www.sapsailing.com which is the general landing page),
and you would only fetch the content for the event you're interested in, even if the cluster you're targeting
with your request has more.
In all subsequent explanations, you may replace the "www.sapsailing.com" hostname by an according per-event host
name to make sure you get to the event you're interested in.
