<h1>SAP Sailing Analytics - Web Services Overview</h1>

<p>
A number of web services are available to query the state of a SAP Sailing Analytics server instance.
Note that different server instances exist, and not all servers hold the same data. Usually, events get
their own URL which is then made sure to point to a server instance holding the data for that event.
We use an Apache reverse proxy to map URLs (and in particular the sub-domain) to a particular server instance.
So, <a href="http://www.sapsailing.com">www.sapsailing.com</a> may end up on a different server instance than
<a href="http://tw2013.sapsailing.com">tw2013.sapsailing.com</a>
or <a href="http://ess40-2013.sapsailing.com">ess40-2013.sapsailing.com</a>. Usually, we hand out a per-event
or per-series URL, such as the ones above (except www.sapsailing.com which is the general landing page),
and you would only fetch the content for the event you're interested in, even if the server instance has more.
In all subsequent explanations, you may replace the "www.sapsailing.com" hostname by an according per-event host
name to make sure you get to the event you're interested in.

Attention:
We are going to introduce a new and more managed WebServices API. The old API is marked as deprecated but will continue to work for some time.
