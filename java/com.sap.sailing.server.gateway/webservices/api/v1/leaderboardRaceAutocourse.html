<h1>SAP Sailing Analytics Webservices API Version 1.0</h1>
<h2>URL: /api/v1/leaderboards/{name}/autocourse?race_column={name}&amp;fleet={name}</h2>

<b>Description:</b>
<p>
     Sets an inferred course in the race log for the race identified by the leaderboardName,
     raceColumnName and fleetName, using a RaceLogCourseDesignChangedEvent. The
     RaceLogRaceTracker will take the event and update a TrackedRace's course accordingly.
     <p>
     
     <b>Note:</b> An existing course layout for the race identified will be replaced by the new, automatic
     course layout. New marks will be added. Repeated execution for the same race, while possible, is not
     recommended as it will lead to multiple marks with the same name.<p>
     
     Several "magical" and heuristic rules are applied to find a course that is better than no course. For this, the
     method looks for tracks recorded in the TrackedRace. If no track is found for any of the competitors, no
     course design is created and no corresponding race log event is added. If one or more tracks are found, the
     tracks are analyzed.
     <p>
     
     <b>Start:</b> When a race start time or at least a
     tracking start time has been set for the race, the tracks are analyzed
     around that time. A start line is defined as the course's first waypoint such that a majority of the tracks
     cross that start line, with a "start boat" on the starboard side of the line when viewed in crossing
     direction, and oriented such that it is perpendicular to the average course of those tracks that cross
     it.<p>
     
     <b>Finish:</b> When no end of race, finish time
     nor a tracking end time has been set, a hypothetical finish
     line is "guessed" as 12h after the start time, spanning the tracks at that time with the leader just crossing it.<p>
     
     <b>Other course marks:</b> If a wind direction is known from a source other than the race course-based
     estimation, e.g., a maneuver-based wind estimation, a manual entry, or a sensor measurement, transitions
     between upwind, downwind, and reaching sections will be separated by adding a ControlPoint with a
     corresponding Waypoint such that the waypoint is passed at the leg type transition. This will allow
     for better analysis of legs split by their type.<p>
