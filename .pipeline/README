This folder contains an Azure pipeline definition that is used for building our
Android companion apps, in particular the Sailing Race Manager app and the
Buoy Pinger app. See also the mobile/ folder for their source code. The
gradle build that is used at the core of this build pipeline is controlled
by the ``build.gradle``and ``gradle.properties`` file in the root folder.
A local Android app build can be achieved by running the ``gradlew``
wrapper script from the root folder.
