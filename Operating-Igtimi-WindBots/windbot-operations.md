# Operating Igtimi WindBots

For wind measurements we're trying to consistently use Igtimi WindBot equipment. The AdminConsole has a tab "Igtimi Accounts" where accounts for the Igtimi YachtBot web site can be managed. WindBots associated with any of these accounts will feed their wind readings, when active, into races being tracked. Operations of the WindBots mainly needs to take care of charging the devices, turning them on when they leave the harbor and turning them off when they leave the race course. This can also be delegated to race officials carrying these devices on their vessels.

# Status LEDs

The devices have three LEDs whose status works as follows:

1. The three LED’s are “power”, “connection”, and “GPS” in order from top to bottom.
2. All the lights should be on when operating normally.
3. Slow flashing is normal while booting.
4. Fast flashing means that function can’t start or has failed - e.g. SIM not inserted.  i.e. you shouldn’t see this
5. During sync, the “power” light blips and the “connection” LED should stay on until the sync has finished.
