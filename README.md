## Building and Running

To build, invoke
```
    configuration/buildAndUpdateProduct.sh build
```
If the build was successful you can install the product locally by invoking
```
    configuration/buildAndUpdateProduct.sh install [ -s <server-name> ]
```
The default server name is taken to be your current branch name, e.g., ``master``. The install goes to ``${HOME}/servers/{server-name}``. You will find a ``start`` script there which you can use to launch the product.

## Downloading, Installing and Running an Official Release

You need to have Java 8 installed. Get one from [here](https://tools.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud). Either ensure that this JVM's ``java`` executable in on the ``PATH`` or set ``JAVA_HOME`` appropriately.

At [https://releases.sapsailing.com](https://releases.sapsailing.com) you find official product builds. To fetch and install one of them, make an empty directory, change into it and run the ``refreshInstance.sh`` command, e.g., like this:
```
    mkdir sailinganalytics
    cd sailinganalytics
    echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/winddb" | ${GIT_ROOT}/java/target/refreshInstance.sh auto-install-from-stdin
```
This will download and install the latest release and configure it such that it will connect to a MongoDB server running locally (``localhost``) and listening on the default port ``27017``, using the database called ``winddb``.

Launch the server from the directory to which you just installed it:
```
    ./start
```
See the server logs like this:
```
    tail -f logs/sailing0.log.0
```

## Docker

To build a docker image, try ``docker/makeImageForLatestRelease``. The upload to the default (private) Dockerhub repository will usually fail unless you are a collaborator for that repository, but you should see a local image tagged ``donaldduck70/sapsailing:...`` result from the build. To run that docker image, try something like
```
    docker run -d -e "MEMORY=4g" -e "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://my.mongohost.org?replicaSet=rs0&retryWrites=true" -P <yourimage>
```
Do a "docker ps" to figure out the port exposing the web application:

CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 79f6faf19b6a donaldduck70/sapsailing:latest "/home/sailing/serve…" 33 seconds ago Up 32 seconds 0.0.0.0:32782->6666/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32781->7091/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32780->8000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32779->8888/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32778->14888/tcp modest_dhawan

In this example, find your web application at http://localhost:32779 which is where the port 8888 exposed by the application is exposed at on your host. In the example with telnet port 14888 mapped to localhost:32788 do a
```
    telnet localhost 32778
```
to connect to the server's OSGi console.

## Docker Compose

If you have built or obtained the ``donaldduck70/sapsailing:latest`` image, try this:
```
    cd docker
    docker-compose up
```
Based on the ``docker/docker-compose.yml`` definition you should end up with three running Docker containers:
- a MongoDB server, listening on default port 27017
- a RabbitMQ server, listening on default port
- a Sailing Analytics server, listening for HTTP requests on port 8888 and for telnet connections to the OSGi console on port 14888

Try a request to [``http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html``](http://127.0.0.1:8888/index.html) or [``http://127.0.0.1:8888/gwt/status``](http://127.0.0.1:8888/gwt/status) to see if things worked.

## Configuration Options, Environment Variables

The server process can be configured in various ways. The corresponding environment variables you may use during installation with ``refreshInstance.sh`` and for setting up your Docker environment can be found in the following files:
- [DefaultProcessConfigurationVariables.java](java/com.sap.sse.landscape/src/com/sap/sse/landscape/DefaultProcessConfigurationVariables.java)
- [SailingProcessConfigurationVariables.java](java/com.sap.sailing.landscape/src/com/sap/sailing/landscape/procedures/SailingProcessConfigurationVariables.java)
