# Planning 2013 / 2014

During our workshop of 2013-09-30, three major areas of development were identified as candidates for focus topics for the next few months. These are:

* [[Data Consistency|wiki/planning/businesscases/DataConsistency]] Status: nothing much has happened here; for improved outlier detection, see [[bug 1836|http://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1836]].

* [[UI-Renovation|wiki/planning/businesscases/UIRenovation]] Status: "newhome" has been developed and deployed which gives sapsailing.com a new, much improved face. Now we need to work on various bugs related to the newhome implementation (see [[bug 1928|http://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1928]]) and continue to improve the site along the same lines.

* [[ORC / IRC support|wiki/planning/businesscases/ORC]] Status: no activity during 2014; we tracked Bart's Bash as a handicap regatta but made no progress in terms of handicap scoring. If we really want to support Bart's Bash in 2015 we should put this subject on the agenda.

* [[Smartphone Tracking|wiki/planning/businesscases/SmartphoneTracking]] Status: much has been implemented in the back-end that supports this, among others a working mark passing detection algorithm, a GPS fix store and "race log tracking" which allows us to import GPS data from any sources into the existing structures for analysis. Now the most imporant missing piece is an easy-to-use app for sailors that can do the tracking and connectivity and which can then be the basis for further analysis features. Working with Ubilabs to get this implemented.

* [[Sponsorship Engine|wiki/planning/businesscases/SponsorshipEngine]] Status: over the course of the year, several components moved from "sailing" to "sse" bundles and have been used also for tennis and equestrian solutions successfully. This activity can continue as a side car as we use the platform for more and more activities. A logical next step could, e.g., be the extraction of the replication feature.

* [[Race Committee App|wiki/planning/businesscases/RaceCommitteeApp]] Status: the app now supports multiple users per course area and for this received sophisticated improvements in its connectivity architecture. The next steps are planned together with Ubilabs and may be supported during the implementation phase by our student pool. Besides cosmetic UI corrections the next steps are a target time calculator and course layout support before we want to move this to the next level where anonymous regattas may use it to define, manage, score and optionally track their regattas.

The links above lead to short write-ups of the respective business case behind the topic, listing the pros and cons and discussing the risks.
