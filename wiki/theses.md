# Theses

## About
Theses written about topics concerning SAP Sailing Analytics can be placed here.

To add a thesis, add and commit the file (ideally `.pdf`) in the folder `doc/theses` on the `master` branch.
Then add a link to that file on this page (either locally by editing this [file](/wiki/theses.md), or through the Gollum web interface), which can be expressed as follows in Markdown Syntax:
```
[title][/doc/theses/<filename>]
```
Now push your changes to the remote Git repository. It will take some time before the file will actually become available through the wiki (the master branch is periodically synchronized and checked out for this wiki).
