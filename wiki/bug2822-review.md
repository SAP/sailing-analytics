**This page has the purpose to prepare and track the progress of the bug2822 review**  
(See https://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2822)  
Bug 2822 changes the way competitors and boats are handled. Specifically the 1:1 containment between Competitor and Boat will be removed as part of the implementation.

# End-To-End Test Scenarios

## 1. Data migration when starting server

### 1.1 Migrate the COMPETITORS collection

Check:  

- Existing COMPETITORS Collection is renamed to COMPETITORS_BAK collection
- Competitors from COMPETITORS_BAK collection will be migrated to COMPETITORS and BOATS collection
- All migrated competitors have a link to a boat from boats collection
- The attribute 'name' is cleared in new all created boat objects as the old names were not meaningful and not used

### 1.2 Migrate an already existing 'competitor with boat' to a competitor with a separate boat

In case of a server instance with already created competitors we don't know to which kind of regatta (with or without changing boats) a competitor belongs to. This will only become clear when the tracking of the already configured races starts. In case of the tractrac connector the decision can be made based on the existence of boat metadata. If we find such boat metadata we must migrate the existing 'competitor with boat' to a standalone competitor and a standalone boat.

Check:

- Before server start an existing competitor with emedded boat does exist in the COMPETITORS collection
- After server start and migration according to 1.1 this competitor does exist in the COMPETITORS collection and does have a link to a boat in the BOATS collection
- After starting the tractrac tracking of a race where this competitor is contained the tractrac connector recognizes the need for the migration and calls the corresponding function on the CompetitorStore
- After the migration the competitor does not have a boat reference anymore and the migrated boat has the right properties

### 1.3 Migrate the raceLog and regattaLog?

We need to be very careful with refactoring here as the logic to load RaceLog/RegattaLog events relies on the class names, see com.sap.sailing.domain.persistence.impl.DomainObjectFactoryImpl.loadRaceLogEvent(DBObject dbObject)...

   if (eventClass.equals(RaceLogRegisterCompetitorEvent.class.getSimpleName())) {  
      return loadRaceLogRegisterCompetitorEvent(..., dbObject);  
   }  

So we really need to keep the class names also for legacy events or we must rewrite the 'RACE_LOG_EVENT_CLASS' or 'REGATTA_LOG_EVENT_CLASS' property of the RaceLog/RegattaLog database entries.

##  2. Managing boats

Boats can be created now in different ways:

- as 'standalone' boats in the boats panel in the admin console (subsection of 'Tracked races')
- together with a competitor when adding a competitor to a regatta where boats CAN'T change per race (e.g. SPT)
- through a tracking connector which creates competitors and boats of a race (e.g. TracTrac tracking)
- through a competitor import from an external competitor provider (e.g. Manage2Sail)

### 2.1 Boats panel

Check:

- Create a new boat
- Edit the created boat

### 2.2 Smartphone tracking using a regatta where boats of competitors can change

Check:

- Create SPT regatta with flag  'boats of competitors can change per race' set to 'false'
- Create a tracked race
- Add a competitor with a boat for this race
- Edit the boat


## 3. Tracking with TracTrac connector

### 3.1. Tracking of existing event league WITH boat metadata

1. Bundesliga 2017 – Lindau:  
http://event.tractrac.com/events/event_20170524_Bundesliga/jsonservice.php  

Check:  

- 6 Boats must be created with correct name, color and sail number (boat number)
- 18 Teams must be created (with short team name as ‚competitor short name‘ (e.g. NRV)
- Regatta attribute ‚canBoatsChangePerRace‘ must be set to true
- MultiRaceLeaderboard: shortName, fullName are visible, boat name is invisible
- SingleRaceLeaderboard: shortName, fullName, boat name are visible
- Overall Leaderboard: shortName, fullName are visibe, boat name is invisible
- In the ‚raceColumn‘ table of the leaderboard the ‚Edit used boats for competitors‘ action must appear
- using the ‚Edit used boats for competitors‘ action the diaog should show the correct linkings between the competitors and the boats for each race

### 3.2. Tracking existing ESS event WITH boat metadata

Checkpoints are the same as in 1.1.  
ESS 2016 – Hamburg  
http://event2.tractrac.com/events/event_20160727_ESSHamburg/jsonservice.php

### 3.3. Tracking of existing sailing event without changing boats

505 IDM 2013 – Berlin:  
http://traclive.dk/events/event_20130917_IDMO/jsonservice.php  

Check:  

- 6 Boats must be created with correct name, color and sail number (boat number)
- 18 Teams must be created (with short team name as ‚competitor short name‘ (e.g. NRV)
- Regatta attribute ‚canBoatsChangePerRace‘ must be ‚false'
- MultiRaceLeaderboard: shortName, fullName are visible, boat name is invisible
- SingleRaceLeaderboard: shortName, fullName are visible, boat name is invisible
- Overall Leaderboard: shortName, fullName are visible, boat name is invisible
- In the ‚raceColumn‘ table of the leaderboard the ‚Edit used boats for competitors‘ action is not visible

## 4. Tracking with SwissTiming connector

## 5. Smartphone Tracking (SPT)

### 5.1 Regatta where boats CAN NOT change per race - Competitors (with boats) are registered on REGATTA level

Check:

- Create a simple SPT regatta where boats CAN NOT change per race
- Open 'Competitor registrations' dialog on leaderboard level
- Dialog must show 'Add Competitor with boat' button
- Dialog must show only competitors with a linked boat in the 'Competitor pool' table on the right side
- The registered competitor must be added to regattaLog via the RegattaLogRegisterCompetitorEvent
- Clicking of 'Boat registrations' on leaderboard level should show a warning message 

### 5.2 Regatta where boats CAN NOT change per race - Competitors (with boats) are registered on RACE level

- Dialog must show only competitors with a linked boat in the 'Competitor pool' table on the right side
- The registered competitor must be added to raceLog via the RaceLogRegisterCompetitorEvent
- Clicking of 'Boat registrations' on leaderboard level should show a warning message 

### 5.3 Regatta where boats CAN change per race - Standalone competitors and boats are registered on regatta level

Check:

- REMARK: The competitor/boat assignments are only possible on the race level
- Create a simple SPT regatta where boats CAN change per race
- Open 'Competitor registrations' dialog on leaderboard level
- Dialog must show a 'Add Competitor' button

- Check the 'Register Competitors on Race' checkbox to enable the registration of competitors
- Add some competitors to the race and click on 'Continue with boat assignments'
- Assign the boats to the competitors
- Check the boat assignments with the 'Show boats used by competitors' action on race level
- The registered competitors must be added to raceLog via the RegisterCompetitorEvent and contain also the assigned boat

## 6. Incremental Leaderboard

Make sure that attribute changes of competitors and boats in the admin console are reflected in the leaderboard shown to the user

## 7. Competitor Import (Manage2Sail connector)

Precondition: Create a result import provider for Manage2Sail  
E.g.: http://manage2sail.com/api/public/links/event/c19b811f-8dd0-4d6f-b846-7d07bd0dead9?accesstoken=bDAv8CwsTM94ujZ&mediaType=json

Check:  

- Create a simple regatta where boats can change per race
- Go to 'Connectors' -> 'Smartphone Tracking -> Select the regatta -> Click on 'Competitor registrations'
- Select some competitors and import them
- The competitors will be created and stored but without boats using the RegattaLogRegisterCompetitorEvent

### 7.2 Import Competitors into regatta where boats CAN NOT change

Check:

- Create a simple regatta where boats can NOT change per race
