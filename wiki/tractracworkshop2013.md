# TracTrac Workshop in Kopenhagen (October 2013)

This page should be used to collect problems and ideas regarding the TracTrac Tracking in order to prepare the upcoming workshop with TracTrac in Kopenhagen.

## Known issues

### GSM network trouble

Particularly for live events, we've seen too many situations in which the GSM network performance was not sufficient for reasonable commentary or even TV coverage.

### Issues with data loss

Trackers sometimes seem to be operated in slumber mode when they should actually serve as backup GPS recording devices which doesn't work in slumber mode.

### Batteries, Energy Management

The trackers need to perform some intelligent battery management. Highest priority in many cases for us is to not lose GPS position data. Second priority is to have it live with short delay. There may be exceptions such as a single medal race on a "TV Course" where live delay is all that matters. In all other cases, the trackers' energy management should rather turn off transmission in lieu of not losing data.

### TracTrac Event Manager

Operators during an event have major trouble understanding and fixing tracker issues. The battery status display is not trustworthy and in some modes known to be flawed. The tracker modes (aggressive, slow, slumber) isn't visible to the operator.

### Standardization of procedures

Currently there is no documentation in place that describes the different aspects of running an event with TracTrac software. This for example holds for pre-race procedures: Before a race or event starts there is no checklist that contains all points needed to ensure that all tracking, the software and architecture is setup correctly. SAP and TracTrac should work together to get such checklists. Areas could be: (SAP|TracTrac) Pre-Event, (SAP|TracTrac) Pre-Race, Race-Officer Pre-Race, Race Committee Pre-Race and others.

## Feature requests

High-quality trackers with short latency, high reliability, reliable energy management, transparent battery life cycle condition, high GPS accuracy with high sampling frequency, acceleration and heel sensors.
