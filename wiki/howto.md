### How to work with this Wiki

The syntax of the markup is relatively easy and is documented here http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus. When you create a new Page then make sure to put some thinking into the right tree structure and then just extend the URL above. 

**ATTENTION**: 

* Make sure to always have _wiki/_ as the base path. So if you want to create `server/SystemBoot` then the correct URL is `wiki/server/SystemBoot`. Make sure to add you Page to the Table of Contents below by editing the document.

* Password can be found in the encrypted page [[Passwords|wiki/passwords]]. You can decrypt it by using `gpg -d < passwords.md` after having entered the password. If you want to edit, first decrypt and then encrypt again using `gpg -a --symmetric passwords.md`. Make sure to never save the unencrypted version!

If you have any questions then either contact Axel Uhl, Jens Rommel, Frank Mittag or Simon PamiÃ©s.
