# How to work with this Wiki

This Wiki is being stored into a GIT repository on branch **master** that is tracking remote branch master of origin at /home/trac/git. The physical location is /home/gollum/wiki/gitwiki. The changes here are pushed to origin on a more or less regular base (every week) by one of the admins.

You can edit information here freely but do not leave any nonsense here.

The syntax of the markup is relatively easy and is documented here http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus. When you create a new Page then make sure to put some thinking into the right tree structure and then just extend the URL above. 

**ATTENTION**: 

* Make sure to always have _wiki/_ as the base path so that contents is not cluttered around. So if you want to create `server/SystemBoot` then the correct URL is `wiki/server/SystemBoot`. Make sure to add your Page to the Table of Contents of [/home] by editing the document there. The contents of java/ is protected so that one can neither write nor read.

* Password can be found in the encrypted page [[Passwords|wiki/passwords]]. You can decrypt it by using `gpg -d < passwords.md` after having entered the password. If you want to edit, first decrypt and then encrypt again using `gpg -a --symmetric passwords.md`. Make sure to never save the unencrypted version! The encryption is a symmetric one (not key based) based on a password that is known to the admins.

If you have any questions then either contact Axel Uhl, Jens Rommel, Frank Mittag or Simon PamiÃ©s.
