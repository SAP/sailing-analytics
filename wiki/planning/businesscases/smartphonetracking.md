# Smartphone Tracking

There are several million active sailors around the world (TODO: get the numbers, grouped by boat class and nation). In comparison, only a small share of them is actively participating in large regattas that are sufficiently prestigious to be supported by professionally-managed tracking infrastructure. Therefore, this large share of sailing events is not currently able to use the SAP Sailing Analytics to understand, analyze and also promote their hobby.

As one of the major obstacles we see the cost and effort to equip an event with the tracking infrastructure necessary. The cost usually divides into three parts:

* Tracker hardware for competitors, marks and optionally wind

* Tracker handling (hand out, collect, associate, charge)

* Operations of a tracking solution (modeling the regatta with its scoring rules; assign competitors to races; monitor and maintain tracking during the races)
