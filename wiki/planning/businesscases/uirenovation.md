# UI-Renovation

After 2 years of functional growth of our SAP sailing analytics we get more and more feedback that our user interfaces are not meeting the user expectations anymore. This applies not only to external users of our solutions but also to colleagues presenting our solutions at sailing events.

## www.sapsailing.com

We have developed a growing number of technical solutions for the sailing world, but we lack a common description of these solutions. Furthermore we get more and more external requests from interested sailing professionals to use our solutions and we would like to provide them a good entry point into our solution world. Therefore a renovation of our homepage describing our solutions is needed.

## Mobile support

Over the last year we have seen a huge increase in the mobile usage of our solutions. During the Kiel week 2013 around 50% of the website access came from mobile devices. As our solutions has been designed for the usage on laptops and PC's we urgently need to improve the user experience for tablet and smartphone devices.

## Sailing Analytics

We started 2011 with a solution for sailing moderators. From there by extended the supported user roles step by step to sailing event visitors, sailors, trainers, race officers, VIP lounge stuff and so on. So far we tried to serve all user roles with the same UI, but as a result the UI is overloaded with too many functions. As we understand the needs of the different user roles much better now, we think that we should provide more focused UI's for specific user roles.
