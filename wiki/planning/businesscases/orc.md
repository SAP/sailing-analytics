# ORC/IRC support

## Rationale

Beside the One-Design racing (where all boats have identical or very similar designs or models) there is another huge category of regattas called 'handicap sailing' where the boats are not identical and therefore have different race conditions. In order to make the boats nevertheless comparable several organisations (ORC/IRC/YardStick) introduced complex rule systems to calculate individual 'handicaps' for the boats. As a result it's even more difficult to follow these regattas and to present them in an attractive way to the audience.
However, as the typical boats in this regatta category are rather big boats the audience and the owner of the boats are an interesting target group.

## Purpose

Provide solutions to help organizations operating ORC/IRC/Yardstick based regattas to manage them and to enable  live moderation of such regattas to make them more attractive for the media, spectators and sailors.

## Features

* Support for different handicap scoring systems (live calculation, live leaderboard)
    * Time On Time
    * Time On Distance
    * Performance Curve
    * Performance Line
* Visualization of live boat positions/ranking incorporating the handicap
* Support of satellite trackers for long distance races
* Optional: Access on board sensors of racing boats (e.g. for wind)
