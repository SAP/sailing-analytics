# ORC/IRC support

## Rationale

Beside the One-Design racing (where all boats have identical or very similar designs or models) there is another huge category of regattas called 'handicap sailing' where the boats are not identical and therefore have different race conditions. In order to make the boats nevertheless comparable several organisations (ORC/IRC/YardStick) introduced complex rule systems to calculate individual 'handicaps' for the boats. As a result it's even more difficult to follow these regattas and to present them in an attractive way to the audience.
