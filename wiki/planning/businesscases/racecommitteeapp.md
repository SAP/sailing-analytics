# RaceCommittee App

## Rationale
As SAP is aiming to make sailing visible and understandable for everyone and also wants to help series and regattas run better, it is crucial to have a direct connection to the race committee and/or umpires. Every decision they make, must in realtime be reflected into the Sailing Analytics application. This holds not only for time announcements but also for complex events like course changes or rule infringements.

With this information the public can closely stay in touch with events and the race itself. Especially when races take place far away from shore and there is no direct line of sight. In addition to that external partners (e.g. TV production) can be fed with accurate information about time frames of a race, data providers can improve their handling based on the stream of data that is produced by the race committee. Last but not least the application itself can rely on these data in order to make decisions on how to display/compute analytics and other useful information.

## Purpose

Provide the race committee with a native mobile implementation, that not only accepts input that is then fed into the analytics server but also helps users doing their job better by providing useful information about course layout, wind, competitors and time. This app should work for a professional race committee but also for a sailor executing a regatta on a sunday afternoon.

The app should exist in two version:

- The first one is dedicated to professionals that run big to mid-sized regattas. This version would heavily rely on tracking and wind measurement devices and the Sailing Analytics server. It would require professional support.

- The second one will be publicly available in the app store. This version will be independent from an advanced tracking infrastructure and will be restricted in it's features. It will still require support from SAP in terms of server infrastructure and general user support.
