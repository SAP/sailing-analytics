# RaceCommittee App

## Rationale
As SAP is aiming to make sailing visible and understandable for everyone and also wants to help series and regattas run better it needs a direct connection to the race committee and/or umpires. Every decision they make must directly and in realtime be reflected into the Sailing Analytics application. This holds not only for time announcements but also for complex events like course changes or rule infringements.

With this information the public can closely stay in touch with events and the race itself that sometimes takes place far away from shore. External partners (e.g. TV production) can be fed with accurate information about time frames of a race, data providers can improve their handling based on the stream of data that is produced by the race committee. Last but not least the application itself can rely on these data in order to make decisions on how to display/compute analytics and other useful information.

## Purpose

Provide the race committee with a mobile app, that not only accepts input that is fed into the analytics server but also helps them doing their job better by providing useful information. This app should work for a professional race committee but also for a sailor executing a regatta on a sunday afternoon.
