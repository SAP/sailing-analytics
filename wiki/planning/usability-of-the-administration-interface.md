# Usability of the Administration Interface

So far, the administration user interface has been developed for a small user group, largely consisting of the developers themselves and a few people at "friendly partners" such as STG or Konzeptwerft whom we can easily educate in a one-day training.

If we want to scale the solution to a much larger user group including sailing clubs around the world, the usability of the administration user interface needs to be re-thought and probably be re-implemented to a large degree.
