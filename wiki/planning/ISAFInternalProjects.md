# ISAF-Internal Projects

According to talks we had with ISAF representatives, ISAF has a number
of internal requirements, largely around existing software projects
and databases. We don't know much about this yet, but we expect work
in the area of the sailors database, world rankings, as well as
management systems for regatta and tracking results.

There is some potential to employ and showcase HANA in this
environment, particularly for the management of historic sailing
regatta results and the analytical applications that could be possible
with it.
