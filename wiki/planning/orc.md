Cyber Altura is free Windows software covering all options of ORC scoring. It does not have any limit in fleet size, number of events, number of races etc. 
All outputs can be configured, adding or removing fields that appear in the listings. Boat data can be imported through RMS files which are immediately updated by every new certificate issued by any Rating Office. A fully functional version is available for download, but expect occasional updates or newer improved versions.

Cyber Altura can be downloaded for free from its website, where there are also all explanations and instructions.

Velum software is fully-compatible with ISAF and ORC scoring rules and can import data from RMS files. It is based on 30 years experience in 300 software licenses worldwide, countless regattas, numerous high-ranking championships, and is used in some of the world’s largest regattas (Nordsee-Woche, Kieler-Woche, Travemünder-Woche, etc.). Velum offers huge flexibility in defining the scoring groups: a yacht can be scored in many different ways and in different scoring groups that may also include other subgroups. Velum is available on its website for a certain fee depending on using the full version or just an update.

**Time on distance:**

Corrected time is calculated as follows:

Corrected time = Elapsed time – (ToD * Distance)

With Time-on-Distance (ToD) scoring, the coefficient of time allowance of one boat will not change with wind velocity, but will change with the length of the course. One boat will always give to another the same handicap in sec/mi, and it is easy to calculate the difference in elapsed time between two boats needed to determine a winner in corrected time.

A special ToD coefficient calculated with an average crew weight of 170 kg is available for double handed racing as well as one calculated for non-spinnaker racing.
