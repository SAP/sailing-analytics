Altura:
***

Cyber Altura is free Windows software covering all options of ORC scoring. It does not have any limit in fleet size, number of events, number of races etc. 
All outputs can be configured, adding or removing fields that appear in the listings. Boat data can be imported through RMS files which are immediately updated by every new certificate issued by any Rating Office. A fully functional version is available for download, but expect occasional updates or newer improved versions.

Cyber Altura can be downloaded for free from its website, where there are also all explanations and instructions.

Velumn:
***
Velum software is fully-compatible with ISAF and ORC scoring rules and can import data from RMS files. It is based on 30 years experience in 300 software licenses worldwide, countless regattas, numerous high-ranking championships, and is used in some of the world’s largest regattas (Nordsee-Woche, Kieler-Woche, Travemünder-Woche, etc.). Velum offers huge flexibility in defining the scoring groups: a yacht can be scored in many different ways and in different scoring groups that may also include other subgroups. Velum is available on its website for a certain fee depending on using the full version or just an update.

**Scoring:**

**Time on distance:**
***
Corrected time is calculated as follows:

Corrected time = Elapsed time – (ToD * Distance)

With Time-on-Distance (ToD) scoring, the coefficient of time allowance of one boat will not change with wind velocity, but will change with the length of the course. One boat will always give to another the same handicap in sec/mi, and it is easy to calculate the difference in elapsed time between two boats needed to determine a winner in corrected time.

A special ToD coefficient calculated with an average crew weight of 170 kg is available for double handed racing as well as one calculated for non-spinnaker racing.

**How is it calculated?**
***
Offshore Time on Distance scoring coefficient also known as OSN (offshore single number) is calculated as a weighted average of the predicted boat speeds in following conditions:

The resulting time allowances at wind of 8 knots will be accounted with 25 %, the one at 12 knots with 50% and that at 16 knots with 25%.

The above scheme takes into account more windward/leeward directions in light winds, which is gradually reduced to have more reaching as the wind increases. 

Double handed coefficient is calculated using the same OSN method with crew weight of 170 kg, while non-spinnaker rating is calculated for boat's performance without spinnaker.

 
**Inshore Time on Distance** scoring coefficients is calculated as the average of windward/leeward course (50 - 50 %) time allowances in three conditions multiplied by their respective weights: 
  
       - 25 % of Windward/Leeward at 8 knots 
       - 40 % of Windward/Leeward at 12 knots 
       - 35 % of Windward/Leeward at 16 knots 

**Time on time:**
Corrected time is calculated as follows:

**Corrected time = ToT * Elapsed time**

With Time-On-Time (ToT) scoring, the time allowance will increase progressively as the wind velocity increases. Course distance has no effect on the results and need not be measured. Corrected time will depend only on the elapsed time, and the difference between boats may be seen in seconds depending of the duration of the races. The longer the race in time, the larger the handicap.

 **How is it calculated?**
 
    
  Offshore Time on Time scoring coefficient is calculated as: 
  
          600 / Offshore ToD 
    
  Inshore Time on Time scoring coefficient is calculated as: 
  
          675 / Inshore ToD 

**Performance Line:**
**Corrected time is calculated as follows:**

**Corrected time = (PLT * Elapsed time) – (PLD * Distance)**

With the time coefficient PLT and distance coefficient PLD, two boats may be rated differently in light or heavy wind conditions, and it is possible that one boat is giving a handicap to another in light wind conditions, while the opposite may be true in heavy wind conditions.

**How is it calculated?**
Performance Line Scoring is a simplified variation of Performance Curve Scoring, where the curve of time allowances as a function of seven wind speeds is simplified by a straight line intercepting the performance points at 8 and 16 knots of wind for a given course. This is shown as follows:

![Certficate](http://www.orc.org/images/certificates/2013/perfline.JPG)

Offshore Performance Line coefficients are calculated using time allowances for the Ocean type of pre-selected course. 
  
Inshore Performance Line coefficients are calculated using time allowances for the Windward/leeward type of pre-selected course. 


**Performance Curve Scoring:**
***
**Performance Curve Scoring:**is the most powerful engine of the ORC International (ORCi) rating system. It is this unique feature which makes this rule fundamentally different from any other handicap system, as it recognizes that yachts of varied design perform differently when conditions change. 

This means that yachts of different designs will have different time allowances in each race depending on the weather conditions and the course configuration for that particular race. For example, heavy under-canvassed boats are slow in light airs but fast in strong winds, boats with deep keels go well to windward, and light boats with small keels will go fast downwind.

**Where is it shown in the certificate**?

![Certificate](http://www.orc.org/images/certificates/2013/Performance%20Curve%20Scoring.png)

An ORCi certificate provides a range of ratings (time allowances expressed in s/NM) for wind conditions in the range of 6 – 20 knots of true wind speed, and at angles varying from an optimum VMG beat to 52, 60, 75, 90, 110, 120, 135, 150 degrees of true wind angle, as well as the optimum VMG run angle.
 
  
Windward/Leeward (up and down) is a conventional course around windward and leeward marks where the race course consists of 50% upwind and 50% downwind legs. 
  
Circular Random is a hypothetical course type in which the boat circumnavigates a circular island with the true wind direction held constant.   
  
Ocean for PCS is a composite course, the content of which varies progressively with true wind velocity from 30% Windward/Leeward, 70% Circular Random at 6 knots to 100% Circular Random at 12 knots and 20% Circular Random, 80% reach at 20 knots.  
 

**How is it calculated**?

The use of PCS is not as complicated as it may appear. It requires the Race Committee provide only a little more data in addition to their usual work of setting up the course, following the wind changes, making starts and taking finishing times. There are different varieties of Scoring software that will do all calculations, which enables results to be ready as soon as the elapsed times of the race are entered.


**Step 1: Define the curse**
 Course may be selected from one of 4 Pre-defined types above or simply constructed with following parameters for each leg: 

- distance 
- course bearing 
- wind direction
