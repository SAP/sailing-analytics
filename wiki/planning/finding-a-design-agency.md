# Finding a Design Agency

[[_TOC_]]

# Meeting preparations

## Questions

1. Wie sieht der Gesamtprozess vom "Verstehen der Anforderungen" bis zur 
"Implementierung" aus? 
2. Wie läuft das Projektmanagement? 
3. Wie werden Designentscheidungen dokumentiert? 
4. Wie werden alternative Entwürfe behandelt? 
5. Wie wird die Usability getestet? (gibt es Usertests? wie oft?) 
6. Wie wird die Kompatibilität der Lösung für den Device-Zoo sichergestellt? 
Euch fallen sicher auch ein paar gute Fragen ein. Dazu kommen Axel's 
Fragen, die eher allgemeine Rahmenbedingungen betreffen: 
7. Frühester Starttermin 
8. Anzahl verfügbarer Leute 
9. Technlogie-Kompetenzen 
10. Anzahl möglicher paralleler Projekte

## Possible Process per Project

1. We define the basic page flow and describe a minimal feature set in a document.
2. A ramp-up workshop with the analytics team and the agency makes sure that everyone at the agency is on the same level
3. Agency creates a design that shows all relevant pages (mockup). This step is delivered by using images.
4. The agency creates a clickable prototype based on the mockups. This prototype must work on all target devices and be implemented in HTML or native UI.
5. Sailing team starts integration with the server.
6. Agency provides long-term support for changes. Lifecycle is communicated with agency.

# Meeting Notes (20.01.2014)

Participants: Axel, Frank, Simon

- We have four projects that we would like to work on with an external agency

1. Race Committee App
2. Analytics Homepage
3. Race Board
4. TV Overlays

- Important to make a decision about what we really want first before going into the process of deciding which agencies to go for. Agreed on the following workflow for each project:

1. We define the basic page flow and describe a minimal feature set in a document.
2. A ramp-up workshop with the analytics team and the agency makes sure that everyone at the agency is on the same level
3. Agency creates a design that shows all relevant pages (mockup). This design is delivered by using images.
4. The agency creates a clickable prototype based on the mockups. This prototype must work on all target devices.
5. Sailing team starts integration with the server.
6. Agency provides long-term support for changes. Lifecycle is communicated with agency.

- The following criteria (order=priority) has been defined and guide the process on deciding for an agency:

1. Design skills show professional work and a deep understanding of mobile devices and user interaction
2. References show that the agency tries hard to understand the domain the project is built for
3. Android skills at least for views
4. Based in proximity of WDF or at least in Germany

- Applying these criteria to the list of agencies, we agreed on the following three agencies:

1. Ubilabs
2. Creative Workline
3. Sysvision

- RaceBoard is a very complex topic. We agreed that we can't decide on the concrete design or the feature set now. But we have a basic understanding how we want to improve it and what we expect from a redesign. We can't decide now if it will be native or HTML5. We include into the projects we need help from the agency but we don't expect a solution right now. Agreed that we will try to get feedback from the agency and then define the project. We tell an agency that they should leave placeholders in the Analytics Homepage project for analytics that we might define later (start analysis, data mining).

- In order to speed up the time to market we discussed the possibility of continuing the work on the Analytics Homepage with App House and later order Pier2Port to implement the prototype in HTML5. We agreed that this could be a way to go as we can't actually give any estimation for the time and effort an agency needs to implement this project. Stefan needs to agree as this would mean to put some more money aside.

- Agreed on the following action items:

1. Creating an email describing who we are and what we want (Simon)
2. Sending out that email and calling each agency in order to schedule a meeting (Simon)
3. Create a document that describes the features for the Analytics Homepage (Frank)
4. Check with Stefan that parallel work is ok (internal=external budget) (Axel)
