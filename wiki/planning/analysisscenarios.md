# Analysis Scenarios

We find that users would like certain analysis scenarios be supported in easier ways than they currently are. For example, one scenario could be "start analysis" and another one "maneuver analysis" whereas a third one could be "wind analysis." Special UI shortcuts and pre-configured perspectives shall support the user in these typical activities.

We need to understand what the ideal UI approach supporting this would be. Is this a portal with portlets and widgets, or is it a set of pre-configured existing components? We will need UID consultancy for this.
