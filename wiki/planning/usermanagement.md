## User Management

User and role management is required mainly for two reasons:

* Offering services to a restricted audience
Example: special add-on services and advanced analyzes available only to sailors and coaches of a particular group

* Remembering user-specific settings
This will include preferences for views such as the leader board, race board and may also help configuring a "portal" with widgets in a personalized way

We need easy to use and manage sign up, sign on, sign out and manage user account features, ideally including e-mail verification and group or role management functionality.
