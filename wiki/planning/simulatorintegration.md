# Simulator Integration

The SAP Sailing Simulator, as can be seen, e.g., [here](http://www.sapsailing.com/gwt/Simulator.html), has a number of features that could nicely be integrated with the SAP Sailing Analytics. For example, at any point in a    tracked race the user could ask the simulator for its prediction of the optimal course and then compare that to the course actually sailed.
