# Simulator Integration

The SAP Sailing Simulator, as can be seen, e.g., [here](http://www.sapsailing.com/gwt/Simulator.html), has a number of features that could nicely be integrated with the SAP Sailing Analytics. For example, at any point in a    tracked race the user could ask the simulator for its prediction of the optimal course and then compare that to the course actually sailed.

Next steps:
- make simulation available as overlay on sailing analytics referring to the currently selected leg
- visualize ladder rungs, i.e. advantage lines plus intermediate isochrones in distance-steps or time-steps
- use multiple wind sources to derive spatially resolved wind field and use it in calculation of ladder rungs and simulation of courses
- extreme sailing series as test-bed for simplified wind measurement unit and operating multiple wind sources during a regatta on boats and marks
