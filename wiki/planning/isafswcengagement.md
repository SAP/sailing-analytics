# Engaging with the ISAF Sailing World Cup (SWC)

The ISAF SWC is a potential sponsorship target. While the cup is currently being redesigned, ISAF would like SAP to sponsor the tracking activities. So far, plans are that SwissTiming will be the tracking partner of choice. After two test events in 2013 with SwissTiming (Palma, Santander), there are still a number of open issues to be addressed. Besides a [number of smaller issues](http://bugzilla.sapsailing.com/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&order=Importance&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&component=SwissTiming%20Connector&product=Sailing%20Race%20Analytics) there is one major open strategic question. Both, SAP and SwissTiming, would like to operate their mobile tablet solution on the committee boats. However, it doesn't seem a reasonable option to require both tablets to be on board at the same time. How important is the mobile showcase for SAP? How much can and will SwissTiming insist on having their own tablet? To what extent should we aim for a solution where the SAP tablet provides all data required to SwissTiming?

If we engage with the ISAF SWC this will mean about five additional sailing events per year, each about the size and complexity of Kieler Woche. We need to discuss staffing, travel and technology budgets before committing to this.
