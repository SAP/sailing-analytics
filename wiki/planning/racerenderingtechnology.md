# Rendering Technologies for Races

Here we want to collect technology options to build a new innovative race viewer.

## Unity Gaming Engine
Unity is a cross-platform game engine with a built-in IDE developed by Unity Technologies. It is used to develop video games for web plugins, desktop platforms, consoles and mobile devices. It grew from an OS X supported game development tool in 2005 to a multi-platform game engine.

The latest update, Unity 4.3, was released November 2013. It currently supports development for iOS, Android, Windows, BlackBerry 10, OS X, Linux, web browsers, Flash, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows Phone 8, and Wii. Two versions of the game engine are available for download, Unity and Unity Pro.
