![](nginx-8.JPG)
<br><br>
* And copy your files into it

<br><br>

## adding a 360 Video

* After navigating into the RaceBoard
* Click manage Media, if this button does not appear, check that you are signed in (upper right corner)
![](managefiles8.JPG)
<br><br>
* Click add at the bottom of the newly opened Media Manage dialog
* You should now see the following dialog:<br>
![](addMedia8.JPG)
<br><br>
* Copy the url of a video from the former part<br>
![](nginx-c.JPG)
* And paste it into the URL textbox<br>
![](addMedia10.JPG)
<br><br>
* Wait for the autodetection. The autodetection will prefill starttime and mimeType with information that can be derived from the video itself, please check that:<br> 
the MimeType is set to mp4panorama in case of a 360 video, or mp4 for a normal 2D video <br> 
Ensure a proper starttime is set, this should be the time, when the recording of the video was started. <br>With the Set to default button, the starttime of the video can be set to the start of the race. <br> It is later possible to properly synchronize the video, if a small delay exists, so this does not have to be perfect, but the fine synchronization is easier if it is close.<br><br>
![](addMedia12.JPG)
<br><br>
* Close the Dialog with OK, a small video player should appear (it's content might be black, this is ok), if it does not appear please try reloading the page
* Using the edit button and the various +&- increment buttons, the video can be fine synchronized if required, do not forget to click save if adjusted<br><br>
![](VideoWorking13.JPG)
* Once the timeSlider is within a valid range (determined by the starttime and duration of the video) the player will start and play concurrently with the map.
