# Images

## Image types and their impact
There are four image types which can be added to an event carrying different roles:

* **logo:** the sailing event or league logo which gets displayed e.g. in the upper left corner next to the name of the sailing event.
* **stage:** used as a banner for the sailing event and gets displayed e.g. on the landing page.
* **teaser:** used to give a preview about the sailing event and gets displayed e.g. in the event overview where all events are grouped by years.    
* **galery:** representing the images which are displayed under the _media_ tab of each event.

## Scale guidelines for several purposes
For performance reasons, images should be scaled before uploading them. The following image resolutions showed up as good manner:

* **teaser:** about 640 x 480 pixel (file size < 100 kB)
* **stage:** about 1600 x 1200 pixel (file size < 500 kB)
* **gallery:** about 1400 x 1000 pixel (file size < 350 kB)
