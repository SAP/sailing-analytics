Note to event organizers: You can send invitation links to competitors after creating an event. Competitors will be guided through the installation and registration process once they follow an event invitation link.

Sail Insight does not require an accout if you have been invited to participate in an existing event. Download the app, scan the Event **QR-code** that you have been sent and tab *"Join Race"*.

# What are the requirements for tracking a whole event?
The minimum requirements are one competitor tracking device for each competing boat and one event creator device for creating and managing the event, course and start times.

Note that the device used for managing the event can also double as a tracking device for a competitor or mark.

For further accuracy and convenience more devices can be added as mark layer buoy pingers or mark tracking devices.

# Default Marks in mark inventory can not be renamed

Sail Insight comes with a set of default marks in the inventory. You can not rename or delete these marks currently. If you rename them in the course creator (via the pen icon next to the mark name), a new mark is actually created. We are working on changing that to keep the inventory lean and easy to manage. The default marks will then be re-nameable.

The basic idea of the inventory is that the marks it contains represent the real physical marks that are being used in a regatta. Device-bindings to these marks are reused to save you the effort of binding devices to marks every time you set up a new event.

**The default marks are:**

- (SFB) Start/Finish Boat 
- (SFP) Start/Finish Pin 
- (W) Windward Mark
- (L) Leeward Mark
- (R) Reaching Mark

In case you decide that the Start and Finishline are not the same, four **more marks** are required:
- (SB) Start Boat 
- (SP) Start Pin 
- (FB) Finish Boat 
- (FP) Finish Pin 

We are working on only creating these additional marks in the inventory when the user decides to use a finish line that is separate from the startline by unchecking the corresponding checkmark for the first time.
