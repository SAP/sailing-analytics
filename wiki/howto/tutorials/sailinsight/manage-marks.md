This episode shows you how to manage *marks* or pair them in **Sail Insight** :

[![manage marks or pair them](https://img.youtube.com/vi/f3fjGuP-SbU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3fjGuP-SbU)

There are **two ways** of placing marks: 
- Pair a mark with a real-world tracking device (another mobile phone) 
- Give it a fixed location by providing latitude and longitude.

Clicking on an event on the *"Events"* tab opens the event overview screen. Select *"Define races"* followed by *"Define course"* to open the course editor for that race where you can edit all tracking properties of a mark.

## Pairing a device with a mark
1. Select the *mark* that you want to edit.

2. Make sure that you selected Tracker for the Tracker / Location toggle.

3. Press *"Change tracking device"*

4. Scan the generated code with another device running **Sail Insight**.

5. When you return to the previous screen, it should now read *"A device is tracking"*.

Note that you need to manually start tracking on all mark marking tracking devices once your event is about to start.

## Pinging or manually editing the location of a mark
1. Select the *mark* that you want to edit.

2. Make sure that you selected Location for the **Tracker/Location** toggle.

3. Press *"Ping position"* to use your current position as the position for the mark. Or press *"Edit position"* to place the position on a map or enter latitude and longitude.
