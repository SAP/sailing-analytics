There are two ways of *placing marks*: 
- Pair a mark with a real-world tracking device (another mobile phone) 
- Give it a fixed location by providing latitude and longitude.

Clicking on an event on the *"Events"* tab opens the event overview screen. Select *"Define races"* followed by *"Define course"* to open the course editor for that race where you can edit all tracking properties of a mark.
 
## Pairing a device with a mark

1. Select the mark that you want to edit.

2. Make sure that you selected Tracker for the *Tracker/Location* toggle.

3. Press *"Change tracking device"*

4. Scan the generated code with another device running **Sail Insight**.

5. When you return to the previous screen, it should now read *"A device is tracking"*.

Note that you need to manually start tracking on all mark marking tracking devices once your event is about to start.

## Pinging or manually editing the location of a mark.

1. Select the mark that you want to edit.

2. Make sure that you selected Location for the *Tracker/Location* toggle.

3. Press *"Ping position"* to use your current position as the position for the mark. Or press *"Edit position"* to place the position on a map or enter latitude and longitude.
