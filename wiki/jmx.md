# JMX Monitoring

Java offers Java Management Extensions (JMX) which is built into the JDK since Java 6. We can use this to monitor the state of a live server VM without the need to attach a debugger or profiler and can thus gain at least some high-level insights into the VM's health status.

In order to gain access to the VM using JMX it needs to be started with a few system properties set:
<pre>
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
</pre>

You can then launch your local `jconsole` tool from the JDK to connect to the remote VM. Ideally, you launch a VNC server on the machine running the Java VM that you want to monitor and execute `jconsole` in a terminal running in that VNC server. This avoids firewall hassle which can be pretty difficult to handle when trying to monitor a JMX-enabled VM remotely.
