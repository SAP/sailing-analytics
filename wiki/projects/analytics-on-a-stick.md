# Sailing Analytics on a stick

[[_TOC_]]

This is a package to enable running the SAP Sailing Analytics from a stick.
It is provided as-is without warranty. The most common usecase is to have a laptop 
running in a lounge that replicates data from a master server that runs in the cloud.

## Create a stick

You need a stick with at least 4GB of free space! 1.6GB will be taken by different binaries, 150MB will be taken by the Analytics server and if you decide to store MongoDB files then another 2GB will be allocated. It is recommended to at least use USB 2.0 and even better 3.0 for good performance. Also make sure that you have at least 1GB of free RAM.

- Copy the contents of $GIT/stick to the root of your USB stick
- Extract the file http://releases.sapsailing.com/stick-binaries-1.2.tar.gz to the root of your USB stick. You should get 5 new directories `mongodb`, `java`, `mongodb-data`, `mongodb-logs` and `server`. Check that `server/logs` and `server/tmp` has been created.
- Install a Sailing Analytics release by executing `scripts/refreshInstance.sh install-release <release>` (this only works under linux or mac)

## Configuration

- (Windows) Copy templates/env.bat.template to the root of the USB stick and rename it to
env.bat. Now open it with your favourite text editor and adapt the values to your needs.
As Windows does not handle data writes on a stick well it is recommended that you also
edit mongodb-windows.cfg and set the dbpath to an existing directory on your hard disk.

- (Linux/Mac) Copy templates/env.sh.template to the root of your USB stick and rename it to
env.sh. Fire up a vi and adapt the values (make sure to at least adapt the system type). It can be wise to also have a look at the conf
for the database that is located in mongodb.cfg. You can specify a separate directory
on your harddisk or a ramdisk for better database performance.

If you have configured the server to replicate then you absolutely need to make sure
that the server version on the stick corresponds to the one that is running in the cloud.

## Starting

- (Windows) First you need to start the database by executing start-mongo.bat. Wait at least
5 minutes until MongoDB has created all necessary files. Before the database hasn't been
initialized you won't be able to start the Sailing Analytics server. After the database
has started up you can start up the analytics server by running start.bat. Watch out for any 
error messages that might come up. After the server has been started you should be able to
reach it by using http://127.0.0.1:8888/.

- (Linux/Mac) All you need is to start the whole thing by executing start.sh. This will take care
of starting up the database and then starting the analytics server.

## Maintain the package

All the binaries packaged into stick-binaries-<version>.tar.gz should normally not need to be updated. Currently they contain the following:

- Java JRE 1.7 for Windows, Mac and Linux
- MongoDB 2.6.1 for Windows, Mac and Linux
- Directories `mongodb-data` and `mongodb-logs` for the database files

All the configuration and start scripts can be found in the Sailing Analytics GIT. If you update the binaries make sure to also adapt the start scripts.
