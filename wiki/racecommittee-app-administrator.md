# RaceCommittee App User Guide (Administrator)

This user guide will help you to configure all your RaceCommittee App devices. The guide is targeted at a multi-device, multi-course-area, multi-race-officer setting. So feel free to omit steps whenever you feel that you don't have to use every feature for your current regatta. It is reasonable to stick to the presented order of steps.

## Configuration of devices

The RaceCommittee App supports remote configuration via the AdminConsole interface on the server.
