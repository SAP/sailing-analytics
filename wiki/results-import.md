# Importing official results

This page describes how to import official regatta results from different external regatta management systems.

## Sailwave

For this description the version 2.16.7 of Sailwave has been used.
Sailwave is a offline Windows software which can export regatta results in different formats.
Although a XRR-Format-export does exist (which would be the best solution) we use the .csv export as the XRR-Export does not export race results (only regatta results).

How to use the .csv export:
Before we can start the .csv export we must change some settings to export the data in the right format:
###1. Select data columns to export

###2. Set points/discard format

###3. Set ranking format

###4. Set language locale

###5. Set column separator and export the data...
In the file menu use the 'Export series summary to windows clipboard...' menu item.
