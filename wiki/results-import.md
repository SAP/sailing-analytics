# Importing official results

This page describes how to import official regatta results from different external regatta management systems.

## Sailwave

For this description the version 2.16.7 of Sailwave has been used.
Sailwave is a offline Windows software which can export regatta results in different formats.
Although a XRR-Format-export does exist (which would be the best solution) we use the .csv export as the XRR-Export does not export race results (only regatta results).

How to use the .csv export:
1. In the file menu use the 'Export series summary to windows clipboard...' menu item.
2. As our Sailwave importer expects the .csv file in a certain format, some adjustments in the settings dialog has to be made:
