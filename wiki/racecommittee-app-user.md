# RaceCommittee App (User Guide)

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction

This user guide is intended for race officers and other users of the RaceCommittee App. The document assumes that you have been handed a fully configured device (see [[guide for device administrators|wiki/racecommittee-app-administrator]]).

## Logon

Each race officer is in charge of managing the races of a course area (Alpha, Bravo, Off-Shore,...). After selecting the active event on the left pane, click on your course area.

In the dialog screen choose "_Login as race officer (start vessel)_". Press **Login**. From now on you will see in the lower right corner the RaceCommittee App icon signaling that you are managing this course area. Using this notification icon you are always able to return back to your race management screen.

## Race management

On the race management screen you see all races grouped by their regatta on the left side. By default the race list is filtered showing only active races. Use the top action bar to switch to "show all races" if you need to see all.

Clicking on a race in the race list opens up the race information screen on the right pane. This screen allows you to umpire a race.

Clicking the back button on your device or touching the home icon (top left corner) logs you out of the active course area.
