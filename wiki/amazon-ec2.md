# Amazon EC2 for SAP Sailing Analytics

Since XXX 2013 this project is using EC2 as the server provider. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a central part of Amazon.com's cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). EC2 allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. EC2 allows scalable deployment of applications by providing a Web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image to create a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an "instance", containing any software desired. A user can create, launch, and terminate server instances as needed, paying by the hour for active servers, hence the term "elastic".

This project is associated with an account that, for billing purposes, is a subsidiary of a main SAP billing account. The account information can be retrieved from one of the project administrators. The account number is "0173-6397-0217 (simon.marcel.pamies@sap.com)" and connected to "SAP CMC Production (hagen.stanek@sap.com)". It has "Dr. Axel Uhl (axel.uhl@sap.com)" configured as operations officer that can be contacted in case of problems with the instances.

The main entry point for the account is https://console.aws.amazon.com/. There you can only log in using the root account. You will then have access to not only the EC2 Console but also to the main account details (including billing details).

Associated to the main account are _n_ users that can be configured using the IAM (User Management, https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home). Each of these users can belong to different groups that have different rights associated. Currently there are two groups:

* **Administrators**: Users belonging to this group have access to all EC2 services (including IAM). They do not have the right to manage main account information (like billing).

* **Seniors**: Everyone belonging to this group can not access IAM but everything else.
