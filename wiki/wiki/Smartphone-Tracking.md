## Prerequisitites
First of all, you need either an online server landscape which is accessible from outside, or a local one with a working setup allowing your smartphone or tablet to establish a connection to.

## Event Setup
Log on to the Administration Console and make sure you have a working Event setup.
For further information on how to achieve this, have a look at [this walkthrough](./wiki/racelog-tracking/walkthrough).
After completing these steps up until the point "Add Device Mappings" or by simply following the step-by-step wizard, you should have the following setup:

* an Event
* a Leaderboard Group
* a Regatta linked to your event
* A Leaderboard linked to your Leaderboard Group

_Hint:_ You can link Leaderboards to a Leaderboarg Group by selecting your group under the tab "Leaderboards" on the left hand side and then selecting one or multiple Leaderboards on the right hand side and adding them by using the "<-" arrow.
Usually this step is carried out by the wizard automatically.

* Competitors in your Regatta
* races denoted for racelog tracking
* defined course layouts for these races
