# RaceCommittee App (Build Environment)

Building the RaceCommittee App has been integrated into the maven build process of the project. This document outlines how this environment is setup. Use this description whenever you need to set it up again.

## Maven

Currently there is no Naven plugin available for Android 3.2 on the internets (see [Maven Repository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.android/android)). Therefore we had to build the correct plugins by hand and place them into http://maven.sapsailing.com/maven/.

## Android SDK

Blub.

## Build-Script

Brom.
