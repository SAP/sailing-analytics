# Inventory Management

We manage our inventory for events by little paper placeholder cards. When taking a piece of equipment our of of the cupboards or from a pelicase, note your name, the date and a purpose on the placeholder card for that piece of equipment. If you can't find a card for the piece you're taking, create one, noting the type and ID of the item in the card's header. Should the item not have a label with an ID on it, create one using our label printer, then write it on the card.

Once you took the item, leave the card where the item was. We'll get you in case you should forget to return the item.

If you plan to hand the item to someone else, perform the above process recursively and leave the card where the item was after you took it, e.g., in the pelicase. This may help you once we go after you to return the item so you know whom to go after in order to get the item back.

Please note that particularly the smaller-sized items such as chargers and HDMI adapters fall under this policy because they tend to get lost even more often.

Thanks for your support and co-operation :-)
