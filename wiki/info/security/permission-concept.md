## Introduction

This document describes the permission concept developed for the SAP Sailing Analytics (in the following just Sailing Analytics). Currently a very rough permission system based on role based access control (RBAC) is used to e.g. restrict access to the administration console. The system is built on the Apache Shiro (in the following just Shiro) framework. This system currently does not support unified user management (in the sense of a central user management system that manages the users for all deployments of the Sailing Analytics) or dynamic access control for all aspects of the Sailing Analytics.

However, as one medium term goal is to develop the Sailing Analytics to be usable by sailing clubs and eventually individuals as a cloud application, the user management and access control should be unified and expanded to be dynamic and provide the appropriate (the Sailing Analytics manages very personal data) security aspects. 
The concept developed in this document should focus on fine grained access control with a strong focus on being able to unify and strengthen the user management and access control. Resulting in a system where multiple organizations and individuals can work on one system without unwantedly interfering in their actions and data. 
A secure access control concept for the existing data model is not easily developed, because the data objects in the Sailing Analytics do not merely form static trees. Data objects can form graphs where there is no clear root for a given node. Furthermore the associations of data objects can change. These challenges have to be addressed by possible concepts by adapting them to this very specific domain.

The following requirements result from the above described (the access control system has to…):

* Be expressive enough to support the complex associations of the Sailing Analytics
* Support multiple organizations (clubs, events and individuals) working in one system
* Communicate the permissions to the frontend (so only UI elements that support permitted actions are active)
* Be reasonably complex and implementation intensive

## Access Control Concepts

The two big concepts that play together in this permission concept are access control lists (ACLs) (also used e.g. in the Linux or Windows file system) and RBAC. Furthermore, there is the concept of attribute based access control (ABAC) that is not explored in this concept document.

The concept of ACLs is based on the idea of assigning each data object that is access controlled an ACL. The ACL is a list of entries that assign a user or group of users to permissions. If e.g. read access is requested for a data object, its ACL is checked if the user or a group, the user belongs to, has an entry granting the read permission.

RBAC is based on the idea of having roles that imply certain permissions and assigning roles to users. The roles of RBAC are on a simple level equivalent to groups for ACLs. (Barkley, 1997) However, in general roles combine a set of users with a set of permissions, whereas groups represent only a set of users. According to (Sandhu, Coyne, Feinstein, & Youman, 1996) there are multiple models for RBAC. The model described above is called RBAC_0. Furthermore, there are RBAC_1, RBAC_2 and RBAC_3 which all include RBAC_0, but add additional features. 

RBAC_1 adds the concept of role hierarchies, where roles inherit the permissions granted by their parent roles. However, they do not inherit the set of users. RBAC_2 adds constraints which restrict how and when roles and permissions can be combined with other roles or permissions. Besides mutual exclusion of roles or permissions, constraints could also require a user to have role s when assigned role r (or the same with permissions, which could be used e.g. to require to be able to view an event when a view permission for a race in the event is granted). Furthermore, the concept of constraints could also restrict the roles and permissions that a user can simultaneously have in a session (e.g. only one tenant role at a time). RBAC_3 combines RBAC_1 and RBAC_2.

In the context of RBAC (Ferraiolo, Cugini, & Kuhn) mentions the concept of subjects. A user may in one session only have a certain set of roles and permissions. This may be due to choice to reduce accidental actions with a wrong role or a constraint enforced by the system (See RBAC_2). This set of roles and permissions is called a subject. A user may have any number of active subjects. However, a subject is only associated with one user.

It is to note that simple RBAC models show no difference in their ability to express access control policies than ACLs. (Barkley, 1997) More complex RBAC models are more expressive than ACLs.

In the course of this concept document there will be no difference in meaning between roles and groups. In the existing system they are named roles, thus the term roles will be used for both roles and groups.

## Initial Idea

The inital idea for this document is based on the existing Shiro RBAC system that handles roles that can imply permissions and that also supports directly granting permissions to a user. Furthermore, ACLs should be introduced. Those should solve the problem of “losing” implied permissions, e.g., upon ownership changes, because the access control lists are directly associated with the data object and do not depend on ownerships, whereas role-implied permissions may well be implied only if ownerships support this. Furthermore, an ACL can be used to explicitly revoke a permission that may otherwise have been implied for a user based on ownerships or the roles the user has assigned.

The existing Shiro authorizing realm that checks for the roles and permissions directly assigned to a user would have to be extended by the ACL concept. This will form what we call a "compound realm" that if a permission is checked looks for the permission in the roles and permissions of the user *and* in the ACL of the data object. If either the roles and permissions or the ACL grants the permission and the ACL does not revoke the permission then the user is allowed access.

## Ownership

The approach chosen here mimics that of a Unix/Linux file system where each file system object has a "group owner" and a "user owner." Certain permissions may then implicitly be granted if the requesting user belongs to the group owning the object or is identical to the user owning the object. Groups in this context are called "tenants."

The tenants represent the organizations and---if a hierarchy is allowed---the sub-organizations working in the system. In the Sailing Analytics the organizations could be SAP in general (e.g. archive server), sailing clubs, events like the Travemünder Woche or in the future private users.

One idea behind tenants is to encapsulate organizations' data so users of one organization cannot work with data objects from another organization if they are not granted the permissions explicitly. Furthermore, tenants are used to group data objects so users can have access to all data objects of a tenant and do not have to be granted every permission explicitly. Additional to data objects, tenants are also associated with roles. Thus, assigning to a user a role associated with a tenant is equivalent to granting the permissions implied by that role for each data object which is associated with (owned by) the tenant.

As will be described later in more detail, ownership information can be used to constrain the granting of roles' permissions. For example, a user may be assigned the "admin" role qualified with a specific tenant so that the permissions implied by the admin role will be granted to that user only for those objects owned by that tenant. The same concept of role qualification can be applied to user ownerships.

Ownerships should usually be assigned to an object upon its creation. For this, the session user may be taken as the default owning user. The owning tenant, however, may not be unique in case the user belongs to more than one tenant. In this case, a disambiguation is required which may happen upon user log-on where the user would have to select one of its several tenants that shall be used as the tenant owner for new objects created during this session.

In some cases, it might be necessary to transfer the ownership to another tenant/user. Thus, ownership should not be final but changeable.

## Roles

Roles have a *definition* and an *instantiation*. The role's definition is an entity that has a UUID, defines a (changeable) name and specifies the (changeable) set of permissions a user will obtain by being assigned a role instantiated from this definition. A role instantiation references a role definition and "inherits" the definition's name. The instantiation can furthermore optionally constrain the role by a tenant and/or user qualifier. In this case the permissions the role definition specifies will be granted to a user in that role only if requested for an object whose tenant/user owner matches that of the tenant/user qualifier provided by the role instantiation, respectively.

Roles with a tenant qualifier are displayed in the form "\<rolename\>:\<tenantname\>". Roles with tenant and user qualifier are displayed as "\<rolename\>:\<tenantname\>:\<username\>", and role instantiations with only a user qualifier are shown as "\<rolename\>::\<username\>". Examples:

1. Tenant Owner "owner:tw2018" (Can delete the tenant, in addition to everything the tenant admin can do)
2. Tenant Admin "admin:kw2018" (Has (almost) every permission in his tenant)
3. Eventmanager "eventmanager:VSaW"
4. Racemanager "racemanager:KYC"
5. Editor "editor:BYC"
6. Resultservice "resultservice:swc2018-miami"
7. User "user::johndoe" (A role that every user should have for himself/herself; grants permissions to modify the respective user object properties such as company affiliation, password and full name

With this it is possible, for example, to have an ``admin`` role definition with permission "\*". An instantiation of this role can then optionally restrict the tenant that must be an object's tenant owner for the role's permissions to be applied to permission checks for that object. If a user has role ``admin:server-A`` and requests permission for an object, the "\*" permission from the ``admin`` role definition is granted if and only if the object's tenant owner is ``server-A``.

Similarly, if a role instantiation provides a user qualifier, the object for which a permission is checked must be owned by the user specified by the qualifier in order for the role's permissions to be granted to a user with this role.

If both, a user and tenant parameter are declared for a role instantiation then both have to match in order for the role's permissions to be implied.

## Permissions

When the permission to perform an action is checked, the action and the object must be identified unless the action is an object *creation*. The possible actions are described by a pair of strings where the first element of the pair tells the "type" of the object to which the action applied, and the second element identifies the action to be performed on the object of that type. For example, ``leaderboard:update`` could be such an action for which permission needs to be requested when changing an object of type ``Leaderboard``.

To request the permission, the object identifier needs to be given... TODO when / backend / frontend / how...

## Defaults upon First Server Startup

When a system starts up for the first time, a set of default roles with default permissions and at least one default user need to be created.

### Role "admin"

This role implies the "*" permission. It should ideally be used with a tenant qualification.

### Role "user"



### User "admin"

### Role for Anonymous Users

When a user has not yet been authenticated, certain actions still need to be allowed for such users, in particular viewing public events or creating a new user during a sign-up activity. One approach may be to simply not request permissions for such actions. This way, all sessions would be able to perform such actions. The downside: in no server configuration would it be possible to limit access to those actions. For example, if one wanted to set up a private server instance where user sign-up is to be allowed only for administrators of that server then this could not be solved by role and permission configuration.

It would be more flexible if there was a role that all anonymous users implicitly have. This role could then by default imply the permissions that we want anonymous users to have. If a special server set-up demands changes then this could easily be solved by modifying the permissions of this role.

## Administration of Authorization

This section will discuss how it is determined if a user can grant or revoke a permission. Therefore, we define two rules:

* We define authority as power which has been legitimately obtained (Krishnan & Zimmer, 1991)
* We regard ownership as the starting point for delegation of authority (Krishnan & Zimmer, 1991)

With these two facts in mind, data objects must have a single user as the owner. User ownership can changed over time. Additionally, as discussed earlier, tenants are a second tier of ownership. Not every user that can create data objects in a tenant should automatically be the owner of every data object of the tenant, but in return should also not lose rights e.g. for removing an accidentally created data object on creation, because the tenant is the owner. Thus, in our approach the creator of a data object will be the owner and the tenant he is currently logged in to will be the owning tenant.

Another challenge after having a concept for ownership is the delegation of power. Not every user should be allowed to delegate his permissions to other users, thus there has to be a “grantPermission” permission that allows a user to delegate all his permissions to other users.

### Implementation of Ownership

Ownership is modeled as an explicit association between exactly one user and data objects and exactly one tenant and data objects. Defaults may exist; a server may specify a default tenant owner for all its objects. User ownership for objects that were created before ownerships were introduced may default to ``null`` as their owner.

Owning a data object implies having all permissions on that object, as ownership is regarded as the source of authority. Technically, this means that a logged-on user is granted all permissions on all objects for which he/she is the owning user.

Tenant ownership has implications only for the application of roles that are qualified for a specific tenant. When a user logs on, the tenant to use as tenant owner for objects that the user creates in this session has to be specified. The user account may remember the tenant that was used last as the default. If not set, the server's default tenant that is used as the default tenant owner for all server objects without explicit ownership information may be used instead.

### Implementation of Sharing Data Objects with Public

In general, sharing a data object with the public should just be granting the “view” permission to everyone. This in return allows everybody that knows the link where one can view the data object to view it.
This is separated from promoting this public data object (e.g. event) on the official SAP site. This would have to be a separate list which can be edited by e.g. media admins. This would however only link to the source, because otherwise all promoted material would have to be imported to the archive.

The ACL will also be checked for permission requests by not authenticated users. This will only apply to ACL entries that are valid for all users.

## Permissions in Frontend

Currently the permissions of the roles are hard coded and can thus be easily imported in the frontend. Dynamic roles that can change at runtime would require passing the permissions implied by the roles to the frontend.

1. One option would be to resolve all permissions of a user before passing the set of permissions into the frontend. In a distributed system with multiple servers where a user could have permissions this is no viable solution.
2. ACLs could be delivered with the object itself. A permission on an object can then be checked in the frontend by asking the ACL delivered with the object. This would require adding a call to the permission system to every remote procedure call that returns an object so as to annotate the object returned with the ACL obtained.
3. A third but possibly resource hungry possibility would be to implement a service that can be called from the frontend to check single permissions. The service would implement some kind of hasPermission(permission) method. This could then be used from the frontend as well as the server code.

As ACLs will probably remain small in general, we will implement the (2) second approach. Furthermore, the ACLs that are returned by the server will be reduced to the entries that are relevant for the current user.

## Permission Defaults

This section will discuss how to handle default permissions. Default permissions for data objects should not be implied by the context they are created in. Implying permissions could lead to unwanted permissions on data objects. There are two options for default permissions:

1. Each type of object has its own mask of permissions it gets assigned. This has the advantage over pure roles that if one wants to change the norm only for one instance of an object one can. The masks could even be editable for each tenant so different defaults can be set. However, this also requires that the default ACL contents are conveyed to the user for checking and display.
2. The creator can choose on creation which other permissions to grant.
3. Have default permissions in roles so they do not have to be entered into each ACL, but have negative permissions to revoke defaults.

The default permissions will be handled by approach 3. to keep the ACLs short and less redundant.

## Constraints

A problem that is not easily solved with either ACLs or RBAC is constraining accesses in a more complex way than checking for a permission. A use case that may be important in the future when clubs can use the Sailing Analytics on their own is as follows.

Clubs may only be able to create races with e.g. < 60 boats, so club events cannot exceed the infrastructure provided to them. How could this be implemented with permission checking?

A "create_big_race" permission could be hardcoded that is checked when a user tries to add more than 60 competitors to a race.

There are even more expressive access control systems than RBAC. They are called constraint based access control systems. They allow constraints to be expressed in a less black and white way, however are very complex. This concept is not supported by the permission concept proposed here, because use cases like the above are probably edge cases that will be hard coded.

## Use Cases

In the following example use cases are listed that describe how user actions will impact the ACLs of the data objects the user interacts with. It is to note that this list of use cases is no complete list of all use cases for the permission handling system. Listing all of them is outside the scope of this document.

It is always assumed that the ID of the user is “user” and the ID of its tenant is “tenant”.

1. Create Event (or any other data object)
  * User creates event
  * Event is owned by tenant that user is associated with in this session
  * Access control list is created for the event
  * Permissions as e.g. “view” are implicitly granted by the roles of the owning tenant
2. Transfer ownership of event (or any other ownership transfer) (Already described in section “Ownership”)
3. Link RegattaLeaderboard into LeaderboardGroup
  * If either the user, a role or a tenant the user is part of, has the permission to edit the LeaderboardGroup (LBG) and view the RegattaLeaderboard (RL), the user can link them. LBG ACL = {“user”:[“edit”]} | RL ACL = {“user”:[“view”]}
  * If the user has the “grantPermissions” permission, the “view” permission will automatically granted to all that can view the LeaderboardGroup.
4. Unlink TrackedRace
  * If either the user, a role or a tenant, the user is part of, has the permission to edit the Leaderboard, the user can unlink them.
5. Share TrackedRace
  * If either the user, a role or a tenant, the user is part of, has the permission to view the TrackedRace and the “grantPermissions” permission, the user can grant view permissions to anybody. ACL = {“user”:[“view, grantPermissions”]}
  * The user shares the TrackedRace with “user2”. ACL = {“user”:[“view, grantPermission”], “user2”:[“view”]}
6. Create GPSFix
  * It would only be consistent to attach a ACL to each GPSFix, however it probably never happens that a GPSFix has other permissions than a whole track, thus I propose to leave GPSFixes without ACLs and only introduce access windows on the tracks that can have their own ACL.
7. Masterdata import
  * This should import all permissions as they are. A masterdata import itself is no reason to change permissions, however only data objects that the user that is importing has a “view” permission for should be importable. If the importing user is the owner or a tenant owner of the imported data, he can also change the ownership.
8. Share event with public
  * If either the user, a role or a tenant, the user is part of, has the permission to view the data object and the “grantPermissions” permission, the user can share the event with the public. ACL = {“user”:[“view, grantPermissions”]}
  * The user shares the data object. ACL = {“user”:[“view”], “*”:[“view”]}
9. Revoke permissions
  * Simply revoke: If either the user is the owner of or the user is a tenant owner/admin of the data object, the user can revoke every permission to the data object from anybody. 
  * Overwrite with negative: the same rules apply as for revoking, however a permissions in the following form is inserted into the ACL. {“user”:[“!view”]}
10. First boot of server
  * On first boot of the server, an admin user is created. The creator of the server will log in as that admin user and in most cases create a new tenant. Thereafter, the creator will create at least one new users, assign the admin role to that user and delete the default admin user.

## Algorithm `boolean isPermitted(PrincipalCollection principals, WildcardPermission permission)` for Composite Realm

The above describes the data model that is relevant to the composite realm that implements the `isPermitted` function. The “permission” parameter should be of the pattern “type:action:instance”. It is assumed that the user (with associated permissions and roles), tenant, ownership associations and ACL entries are available. The following describes in which order the different sources for permissions are checked and how they depend on each other.

1. Check if the ACL entries grant or explicitly revoke the permission to the user under consideration of the user’s roles
  * If there is an entry, return true if granted and false if revoked, but take the most explicit entry and in doubt return false
2. Check if the permission is directly assigned to the user
  * If this is true return true
3. Check if a role grants the permission to the user, which for instances of qualified roles requires the tenant/user parameter values to match the object's tenant / user.
  * If this is true return true.

## Migration
With such an extensive existing system as the Sailing Analytics Suite, migration is a big concern. The existing RBAC system is easily extended to support ACLs. However, implementing permission checking in the whole system will be a long process, because probably almost every service request will have to be edited.

Another challenge besides the code changes is the data migration. We don't want to have to create ACLs and ownerships explicitly for each and every object. Instead, reasonable defaults are required. We assume that each server has a server name which is usually provided by the ``SERVER_NAME`` environment variable during server startup and is passed through to the ``com.sap.sailing.server.name`` system property. These names are expected to be unique across the landscape and shall serve as the name for the default tenant assumed to be the tenant owner for all objects in that server. Of course, ownerships can explicity be defined for new objects or adjusted for existing ones.

As default user owner we will not provide a default value, leaving it with a ``null`` value. This means that by default no user automatically obtains ownership permissions on any object. This seems a backward-compatible approach because so far there is no user ownership at all, hence no permissions have been implied through such an ownership.

**Role Migration**

Following roles have to be migrated to dynamic roles. Beforehand they were hard coded in the SailingPermissionsForRoleProvider class. However, aside from the admin role, all roles listed here are only containing permissions that are checked in the frontend for showing/hiding tabs in the different menus.

* admin
  * "*"
* eventmanager
  * "manage_media"
  * "manage_mark_passings"
  * "manage_mark_positions"
  * "manage_all_competitors"
  * "manage_course_layout"
  * "manage_device_configuration"
  * "manage_events"
  * "manage_igtimi_accounts"
  * "manage_leaderboard_groups"
  * "manage_leaderboards"
  * "manage_leaderboard_results"
  * "manage_racelog_tracking"
  * "manage_regattas"
  * "manage_result_import_urls"
  * "manage_structure_import_urls"
  * "manage_tracked_races"
  * "manage_wind"
  * "event"
  * "regatta"
  * "leaderboard"
  * "leaderboard_group"
* mediaeditor
  * "manage_media"
* moderator
  * "can_replay_during_live_races"

During role migration again the server's default tenant derived from the server name comes into play. If a user had the ``admin`` role assigned on a server, this role must be qualified now to limit its scope to what the user was effectively granted permissions to, namely the objects in the current server. This can be achieved by qualifying the ``admin`` role with the default tenant derived from the server name and by making this tenant also the default tenant for all users in the server. With this, new objects will be created by all users with this default tenant as the tenant owner, so users with the migrated role ``admin:the-default-tenant`` will still have full administration privileges for all objects created on that server.

## Implementation Details

Access control relevant objects are stored in the AccessControlStore, while user related objects are stored in the user, i.e. the UserStore. Tenants are currently stored as UserGroups in the user store. The algorithm outlined above is implemented in the PermissionChecker, which is one of the most central classes in the permission system. Therefrom it should be possible to find all other relevant classes. Other relevant classes include the AbstractCompositeAuthorizingRealm that implements permission checking in Shiro. Therefor it uses the PermissionChecker and is connected to the UserStore and the AccessControlStore. Furthermore the RolePermissionModel implements how roles imply permissions. The RolePermissionModel as well as the parameterization of roles need more work and are just a rough sketch. The UserManagementService exposes most of the access control relevant parts to the frontend. It works through the SecurityService with the AccessControlStore and the UserStore. Permission checking in the frontend is also done with the PermissionChecker. To ease the creation of WildcardPermissions, a PermissionBuilder was introduced that also needs some more work. All access control relevant UI parts can be found in the "Advanced" tab under "User management" and "Tenant management". A further tab "Access Control Management" should be introduced. Unit tests can be found in the package com.sap.sse.security.test.



### Discussion

#### Users and/or Tenants as Owners

A problem with the tenant approach is that users could have no permissions to e.g. remove data objects that they have just created by accident, because the remove permission is reserved to admins of the tenant which a user who has create permissions may not be.

Four solutions come to mind. (1) The creator of a data object could always be granted the permission to remove the data object explicitly. (2) Moreover, the log where the creation was logged could be crawled to find the user that created the data object and override the permission system when in a certain timespan.

(3) There is an alternative approach to ownership. In this approach, a single user would own a data object so he can do everything with it. The tenant would then be a kind of secondary owner or group in Linux terms. This solves the problem that users could have no permissions to e.g. remove data objects that they have just created by accident. However, it also introduces a second layer of ownership. (4) Only grant the create permission when the user also has the corresponding delete permission.

Approaches (2) and (4) are impractical. (2) is too complicated. The user would need delete permission for everything in the tenant for (4) to work.

Approach (1) solves the problem on hand, however these explicitly granted remove permissions are not just removed when the ownership of the data object changes, but remain. This could lead to users being able to delete data objects in other tenants, just because they created the object. Approach (3) more explicitly creates an ownership relation that can be edited and is thus chosen.

As the tenant is a data object itself, it also has an owner. The owning tenant of a tenant is the tenant itself. (TODO: Should it be possible to change the tenant owner of a tenant? What is the best default tenant owner for a tenant? The tenant itself or the tenant to which the user creating the tenant is currently logged on?)

#### Subtenants

Subtenants could be a convenient way to restrict the permissions of certain users to only a part of a tenant’s domain. However, this introduces a hierarchy of tenants that brings with it its own challenges. Imagine there is a tenant “tw2017” and the 49er boat class races should not be manageable by the same race managers that can manage races of the other regattas. So “tw2017” would require a subtenant “other” and “49er” that encapsulate the 49er boat class and everything else from each other. Now if a permission is checked on an ACL, the ACL has to traverse the tenant hierarchy to find out if the user is part of a role for a parent tenant that grants the permission. However, the convenience of tenant hierarchies might be stronger than the traversal problem, because the hierarchy will probably never be deeper than one or two levels.

Another challenge with subtenants is how to communicate the concept to users. Which also makes it harder to imply with which tenant or subtenant a user is currently working.

An alternative strategy is just creating a completely new top level tenant for the 49er boat class races of “tw2017”. This would not introduce a hierarchy, but would require users that have roles for all boat classes to have their roles for both tenants instead of only the role for the parent tenant.

For now, we will not consider the concept of subtenants further.
