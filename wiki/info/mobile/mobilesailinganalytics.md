# Mobile SAP Sailing Analytics

When using the current HTML version of the SAP Sailing Analytics on a mobile device, performance and usability is far from optimal. Native versions can help to improve this. Nemrude (Rudi) Verzano's team is currently working on a first native iOS version of the sailing analytics.

## Online / Offline

Different architectures are conceivable for a purely offline, non-live version and a live-enabled online version.

## To HANA or not to HANA

Some say that a mobile showcase is only a good mobile showcase if it revolves around HANA. Would this have to create a dependency on HANA that makes it impossible to use a mobilized version of the SAP Sailing Analytics without a HANA installation? What would be a good HANA showcase in our environment, above and beyond what we already have in terms of extracting some key figures into HANA and having BOBJ tools work on top of these? How "authentic" would a showcase need to be? Should there be different mobile versions of the sailing analytics for different use cases?
