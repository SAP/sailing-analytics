# NMEA
This page gives a short summary on the first attempt to integrate data from a sailing vessel's nmea network into the SAP Sailing Analytics during my three month internship from 01/17 - 03/17. The current code is a prototype and can not be integrated into any productive release.

## GOAL
The reason for the integration of NMEA data into the SAP Sailing Analytics is the assumption that the GPS of a sailing vessel is better than the GPS of a smartphone. Therefore it desireable to retrieve the data from the vessel's GPS if available. Furthermore most sailing vessels have additional sensors like wind sensors. The wind data from a vessel could be used as an additional wind source.
