# User Management and Security

As a feature of the Sports Sponsorships Engine (SSE) which underlies the SAP Sailing Analytics, our Tennis engagements, parts of the Equestrian contributions and in the future perhaps more, we are about to introduce user management to the platform. Based on [Benjamin Ebling's Bachelor thesis](/doc/theses/20140915_Ebling_Authentication_and_Authorization_for_SAP_Sailing_Analytics.pdf) we are introducing [Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org) to the platform.
