### The Pitch

Like businesses, sailors need the latest information to make strategic decisions - but they need it even faster. One wrong tack, a false estimation of the current, or the slightest wind shift can cost the skipper the entire race. As premium sponsor of the Kieler Woche 2011, and co-sponsor of Sailing Team Germany (STG), SAP is showing how innovative IT solutions providing real time data analysis can give teams the competitive edge.
