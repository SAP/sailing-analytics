# Welcome to the SAP Sailing Wiki

This is the SAP Sailing Analytics Wiki where useful information regarding this project can be found. This Wiki is being stored directly into the default GIT repository on branch **master**. You can edit information here freely but do not leave any nonsense here.

The syntax is relatively easy and is documented here http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus. When you create a new Page then make sure to put some thinking into the right tree structure and then just extend the URL above. 

**ATTENTION**: Make sure to always have _wiki/_ as the base path. So if you want to create `server/SystemBoot` then the correct URL is `wiki/server/SystemBoot`. Make sure to add you Page to the Table of Contents below by editing the document.

If you have any questions then either contact Axel Uhl, Jens Rommel or Simon Pami√©s.
