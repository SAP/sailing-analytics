# Welcome to the SAP Sailing Wiki

![SAP Logo](http://analysis.sapsailing.com/themes/logo.png) This is the SAP Sailing Analytics Wiki where useful information regarding this project can be found. This Wiki is being stored directly into the default GIT repository on branch **master**. You can edit information here freely but do not leave any nonsense here.

The syntax is relatively easy and is documented here http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus. When you create a new Page then make sure to put some thinking into the right tree structure and then just extend the URL above. 

**ATTENTION**: 

* Make sure to always have _wiki/_ as the base path. So if you want to create `server/SystemBoot` then the correct URL is `wiki/server/SystemBoot`. Make sure to add you Page to the Table of Contents below by editing the document.

* Make sure to encrypt passwords and other sensitive data using the symmetric cipher available from the administrator. Encryption and decryption can be done by using gpg. Encryption `echo "username, my-password" | gpg -a --symmetric` and decryption `gpg -d < my-data.gpg`

If you have any questions then either contact Axel Uhl, Jens Rommel or Simon PamiÃ©s.
